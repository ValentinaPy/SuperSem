05-093_Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Chile_68	wikipedia	Contrary to the case of many other Latin American cities where the private sector was asked to provide services, the Chilean service providers were financially self-sufficient when the private sector took responsibility for them.  The public companies had been prepared to gradually improve efficiency and profitability since the legal reforms of 1988-1990.  This may explain the stable process of private sector participation compared to other Latin American cases.  A factor that explains the continuity of sector policies during various administrations is the fact that all Presidents since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 belonged to the same Coalition of Parties for Democracy.

If it happens that all members currently sitting on the Court have already served as president, then the rotation starts all over again.  However, due to the existence of a compulsory retirement age, and the consequent appointment of new ministers to fill those vacancies, it is very rare for the cycle to be completed and re-started, and some ministers are forced to retire before their turn in the presidency arrives.  According to the same convention, the Court selects as vice-president for a certain term the minister who, according to that tradition, will be selected president in the succeeding term.

05-028_Dry_Lab_11	wikipedia	The general approach in the elucidation of protein structure has been to first purify a protein, crystallize it and then send X-rays through such a purified protein crystal to observe how these x-rays diffract into specific pattern--a process referred to as X-ray crystallography.  However, many proteins, especially those which are found embedded in cellular membranes, are nearly impossible to crystallize due to their hydrophobic nature.  Although other techniques exists, such as ramachandran plotting and spectroscopy, these alone generally do not lead to the full elucidation of protein structure or folding mechanisms.  As a means of surpassing the limitations of these techniques, projects such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding%40Home and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta%40Home are aimed at resolving this problem using computational analysis, this means of resolving protein structure is referred to as protein structure prediction.  Although many labs have a slightly different approach, the main concept is to find from a myriad of protein conformations which conformation is of the lowest energy or, in the case of Folding@Home, to find relatively low energies of proteins that could cause the protein to misfold and aggregate other proteins to itself -- like in the case of sickle cell anemia.

01-006_Altitude_sickness_55	wikipedia	For centuries, indigenous cultures of the Altiplano, such as the Aymaras, have used coca leaves to treat mild altitude sickness.  In high-altitude conditions, oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of altitude sickness, or hypoxia.  A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms.  At 3,400 m (67 kPa), raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of 3,000 m (70 kPa), which is more tolerable for surface-dwellers.  The most effective source of supplemental oxygen at high altitude are oxygen concentrators that use vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) technology.

01-025_ECF_grading_system_12	wikipedia	There is one proviso in the calculation: grades more than 40 points different from one's own grade are considered to be exactly 40 points different when calculating performance grades.  Had Player B's grade been 100, Player A would have scored 120 - 50 + (100x1) = 170, and Player B 140 - 50 + (100x0) = 90.  This prevents players increasing their grade by losing to much higher-graded players (but because this applies whatever the result, as a side-effect it protects stronger players by lessening the impact of a defeat by a much lower-graded player).  At the end of a season, each player's performance grades for that season are averaged to give the personal grade used for the following season.

Common land was then enclosed —a flock of sheep only needed a handful of shepherds to look after them, and villagers who were no longer required were evicted from the lands.  The process of enclosures flourished throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, and led to many thousands of villages being deserted.  This led to poverty and homelessness amongst rural dwellers, and gave rise to mass revolts in 1536, 1569, and 1607.

02-089_Settler_colonialism_7	wikipedia	This philosophy is in contrast with the exploitation colonialism, a policy of conquering distant lands not with the intention of supplant its population, but just to exploit its natural and human resources.  The reasons a motherland can have to pursuing the first goal are to lighten the pressure its growing population apply to its home soil, and shape other parts of the world according its image, thus extending overseas its territorial continuity and preserving it indefinitly.  The reasons that push a country to choice the second option are to reach more immediate benefits, extracting cheap raw materials and enslaving directly or indirectly its inhabitants.  Imperialist powers may opt for one actitude or the other, or both at the same time.  Perhaps the most clear example of this difference is the British Empire, whose white population settled mainly North America and Oceania exterminating in the process the native population and building modern infrastructures, and disregarded the Indian subcontinent and Africa, already densely populated.

B00009MGU9_98717	Reviews_Video_Games	"I've been playing the game for the last month and just past my subscription renewal point without cancelling, but I don't think I'll go that much further with this game.  Horizons does many things right, but has a few things wrong with it that really ruin the game experience. Graphics look good, but not always smooth.  A high end system is required to run this game and you'll be tweaking the settings even with the best of systems.  As the biggest memory hog game ever created, it will chew through 1 gig of memory real quick and a Radeon 9800 pro 256 becomes ""not enough"".  There's a good side of this though:  Even at low settings, it looks great and you will spend time just staring at the landscape and stars.  Like EQ, most lag occurs in high populated areas such as towns and cites probley a result of bad net code just as much as graphics. Horizons has the best sound and music I've heard in a game.  They really spent some time and did it right and the music will haunt you once you hear it.  It changes as you enter different environments and really enhances your experience.  Game designers can learn alot from Horizons when it comes to the music. The main challenge facing Horizons is it's content.  There's barely any at all.  The only real content you'll find in horizons is what you create yourself.  Quests usually involve collecting 10 things of ""this"" or kill 30 of ""that"" and are just plain stupid. Many quests will have you running here or running there being a mad messenger of sorts.  While this follows what's been seen in other MMORPG's, Horizons fails in it's attempt as there's no real sense of danger in it.  Dying in Horizons gives you a ""death penalty ticket"".  You don't have to get back to your corpse, no loss of XP, you just get a ticket that reduces your effectiveness for eight hours.  I have never felt this effect and can't tell the difference.  There is no fear of death in Horizons, no real penalty.  Go ahead and kill that big golumn, it doesn't matter if you die, you can just try again.  There's no real sense of adventure here. Crafting becomes tedious.  The placement of resources in the game at higher tiers is designed to get you running back and forth for hours between gathering and processing of them.  While many things are done right with the way Horizons does crafting, it becomes a chore.  Spending four hours mining ore and creating things raising your level, then rinse and repeat. Where's my monsters?  While other games had all sorts of monsters everywhere you run, Horizons has hardly any. They usually group in area's and can easily be avoided.  Even if they do come at you you can easily outrun them.  For fun I aggro'd an entire army of undead and tried to train them into town.  In other games this would be a horrible thing, but in Horizons they just head directly back and give up at a certain point - not going after anyone else they pass along the way.  Again, there's no sense of danger here. Unlike others, the game bugs are providing me with an endless source of entertainment.  I don't get upset like so many others.  It adds a challenge when the game crashes right in the middle of taking on two higher level creatures, or right when my group needs me the most.  It adds a real world element to the game and sense of urgency as I scramble to get back in through the web portal they've created.  To me, this is a game feature that should be explored further and could really invoke some strong gameplayer emotions.  The Devs are scrambling. I have hopes for this game.  There are many things to like about it and it seems a shame that it was rushed out the door so quickly.  They can fix it.  I think it will be a better game in a couple of months.  With the other MMORPG's coming (World of Warcraft/EQ II) it had better be."

I had my basement finished last year and decided to have lights hardwired in the closets down there since there's less natural light.  I came to realize that having a light in a closet makes seeing in the closet a whole lot easier.  I didn't want to pay an electrician to hardwire lights in my other closets and searched for LED puck lights that could be screwed in rather than simply stuck to the wall with an adhesive that would end up damaging the wall.  I decided on these and they're great.  The light is fairly bright and there are two brightness settings.  The light fully rotates and can tilt.  They come with velcro adhesive tape but i installed them with the included screws.  I would have given them 5-stars if there had been two screw mounting holes since i think that would make them incredibly stable and secure.  Also, the included screw heads seem a bit small and i may change the screws to something with a slightly larger head when i paint the closets in the spring.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Our neighbors are used to it..in fact after watching us do the fire drill several times our neighbors bought ladders too.  In regards to ages. Our youngest was 4 years old the first time we practiced the fire drill (I should note the first few times my husband assisted each of the children and for the younger ones I was in the bedroom and he was on the ground on a ladder to help guide them). This ladder has taught our children to not fear because we are prepared, worth every dime!  The ladder is strong.. the heaviest person we have had on it was 250 pounds.

B000B7QDBC_35115	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"Buying racquetballs is confusing, even for someone like me who plays regularly and has used all of the different colors at one point or another. Someone should create an in-depth, brand-by-brand guide, but for now I offer you a brief tutorial on the different colors and their standard uses.  BLUE - For amateur or recreational players - These are the cheapest and most commonly used ball and can be found in Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store. They work fine but tend to break more easily than others and tend lose their bounce faster than others.  RED - The fastest option - A lot of people who I play with prefer the red ball, the fastest ball on the market, and I didn't realize until doing a little research that the red ball is actually intended as an outdoor ball since that extra liveliness is needed on an outdoor court. With a fresh red ball, it can feel like you are playing with a rubber bouncy ball, which can be both fun and frustrating. The nice thing is that even after many plays the ball still has decent bounce, so it may be the longest-lasting option. This ball favors those with a power game. This ball is not available at all sporting goods stores so you may want to buy it online.  PINK - Basically the same as red, but probably easier to see - Of the serious racquetball players I know, the pink ball is probably their favorite, and not just because it appeals to their feminine side. I think the primary reason is that it is as lively as the red balls but probably a little easier to see (red can be hard to see because red, white, and brown all blur together at high speeds). I may be misjudging since I've only used it a couple of times, but the pink ball also seems slightly thicker and sturdier than the red ball.  PURPLE - Another fast option; most common ball on pro tours - This is the fastest ball that is expressly designed for indoor play (unlike the red or pink balls). It's probably the most commonly used ball on pro tours as it is the official ball of the IRT. However, with this ball you should be careful that it says ""HD"" in the name because I'm pretty sure there are some balls that should be in the blue category but just happen to be colored purple.  GREEN - A fast-ish, sturdy option - This might be the second-most commonly used ball behind blues and can be found at many sporting goods stores (but not at Wal-Mart, most likely). It's not as fast as the purple or red but faster than the blue, so is a nice in-between ball. I've also found that it tends to be a fairly sturdy ball, resistant to breaks. On the downside, some people seem to have trouble seeing the green ball (especially if they are colorblind).  BLACK - Slowest ball, for ralliers - Technically, the black ball is designed to be the slowest to allow for the longest rallies, so it may be the ball preferred by people who can't move as swiftly or who have more of a finesse game. But it gets confusing, because I've played with two different brands of black balls, one that was the worst I have ever played with (called Slazenger Black) because it felt like I was playing squash -- the ball wasn't just slow, it didn't bounce! -- and the other brand I played with (don't know what it was; maybe Ektelon) felt near-perfect because it was slightly heavier than the typical ball but still had good bounce, so it was easy to anticipate while also bouncing at reasonable height. If I can figure out what that brand was, I will update this post.  ---  Bottom line: I suggest the pink ball if you are looking for a lively ball and short rallies, the black ball (but not the Slazenger!) if you are looking for a slow ball and long rallies, or the green ball if you are looking for something in between. The blue ball is also fine if you're just looking for something basic and cheap.  Prices will typically be cheaper (probably 15-35% cheaper) if you buy them in-store, but a lot of stores don't have a great selection or don't allow you to buy in bulk, so there are benefits to buying online, too. I'd suggest checking out a price search engine like Google Shopping before buying online."

At $46 it is amazingly reasonable (compared to $81 from both Buck's website and local distributors). Feels like a sturdy finish, but I haven't had the chance to give it any real use yet, so we'll see. Update: 4 years later it is still one of the sharpest knives I own, very reliable. The handle and finish have survived a long list of excursions: camping, kayaking, backpacking, rock climbing, hunting, fishing, I've used it for almost everything. It requires very little maintenance, just keep it clean, and the rarely needed fine grit sharpening. The sheath has not held up as well, the leather began to chip relatively quickly compared to my other leather products, however the damage is almost exclusively cosmetic.

B0009V1WQQ_29300	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	These are a bit heavy but the weight is worth it. They are as strong and massive as a set of leg irons. They are also a little too short if you envison using as a cable alternative. They advertise 22 inches, but that is the outside length. The practical length is 20 inches. On a typical bike rack they are great as you can lock both the bike rack and the frame within one cuff and use the other for the wheel or to lock the frame in a second location. However you may not be able to get this around a tree or light post. Depends. The replacement guarantee comes with all sorts of restrictions, so if your bike is expensive get insurance. I am giving it four stars because of the length. The links between the cuffs [very sturdy by the way] are the least expensive and lightest part of the lock. It is inexcusable that they didn't use twice as many links. It would have made this a much more practical lock.

B000E3QUB6_45683	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I write this only to vent my frustration.  I recently purchased a Gerber LMF II survial knife.  I have been a loyal user and buy of Gerber products for many years because 1. Quality and 2. American made.  I am a seasoned vet that many times made use of my Kabar knife while in Vietnam but have found that Gerber is for me.  I ordered the Black LMF II after reading the generalized description and of course I closely watched the video you present on Amazon.  Again my impression of Gerber rose to high levels, understanding that all are made in the USA.  Shame on me for NOT reading the specs on the particular knife I ordered!  On arrival the first thing that hit me was that the packaging was destroyed and the knife and scabbard were loosely bouncing around the Amazon carton.  No damage, just terrible presentation.  THEN.I saw a large sticker on the carton MADE IN CHINA.  WOW what a wake up that was and is.  I have always thought Gerber meant USA Pride but that has now left my mind.  Again, I should have read the description, BUT after watching the video I was solidly sure I wanted this black knife.  Quality any different I asked myself.  I haven't a clue.  I would return this knife if it wasn't for all the hassle of boxing it up and running it to the nearest post office (25 miles from me).  I only can say this, I will not purchase anything further from Gerber and will make sure that this story is told over and over.   My loyalty has been challenged and Im afraid I can no longer be loyal to Gerber.  This knife?  It is in the bottom of a drawer in my garage.  I will carry my Kabar from now on.

B000BY66JO_41907	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"IMPORTANT, PLEASE SEE UPDATES AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW.  This review is for the BARSKA 18-36 X 50 BLACKHAWAK ANGLED SPOTTING SCOPE WITH SOFT CASE AND TRIPOD. This review does not apply to the other Blackhawk series of spotting scopes that have higher magnifications that may come with a hard case or other level of accessories. Please be careful when reading other reviews for this product that may refer to the Blackhawk spotting scope of larger magnifications that are supposed to come with a hard and soft case. THIS scope only comes with a soft case.  ------------------------------------------------------------  I coach high school and junior air rifle shooters and was looking for an inexpensive shooting scope when I came across this little gem. While the name sounds vaguely eastern European, this scope is actually made in China. The scope has a lightweight but sturdy fiber-reinforced composite body and a back housing that is encased in a generous layer of rubber for shock protection. A hard plastic cap screws on to protect the eyepiece and a hard plastic dust cover friction fits into the front to protect the objective lens. An extendable sunshade is a nice and useful touch.  The magnification is perfect for shooting competition targets at ten meters. (Be careful when comparison shopping as many spotting scopes won't focus down this close.) We use it at the lowest 18x power setting and can see the whole target sheet while still viewing the individual bullseyes and pellet holes clearly. Like nearly all inexpensive scopes, the higher power settings are less useful as the picture darkens considerably and distortion around the edges becomes apparent. If you are looking for a scope for long range shooting or viewing, one with a larger objective lens would probably be a better choice.  Eye relief is good. Many inexpensive and compact variable power scopes have either a very short eye relief or a small field of view in order to save on the cost of manufacturing the lens elements in the eyepiece. With this scope, you don't have to tickle the lens with your eyelashes in order the see the entire field of view.  The only knock that I have on this setup is with the case and tripod that come with the set. The case doesn't offer much protection and the tripod is too small and lightweight to be useful. But then again, our school was able to purchase four of these scopes for the same price as a single ""name brand"" shooting scope with similar features. While I can't vouch for its long term durability this scope is perfect for what we use it for. If it lasts for four seasons of shooting, I would consider it a great value.  Update 2-25-09: So far, so good! I would still recommend these spotting scopes. The scopes have held up well with no problems. We liked them so much, the school bought 15 more. We bought briefcase style, foam filled pistol cases to store them in and they work great. Three will fit in a standard four pistol gun case. We've taken them traveling with no problems. After two seasons, no cracks, leaks, fogging, misalignments, peeling or flaking.  I even found a use for the soft cases the scopes came in. The kids use them to store their shooting equipment including their slings, safety glasses, glove and other bric-a-brac.  Update 3-3-2010: Another season and the scopes are still holding up just fine. Only one problem has been encountered so far. On one of the scopes, the mounting nut pulled out of its base. The base is plastic and the brass nut appeared to be simply press fit into the base. Of course, the coach promply lost the nut before he could fix it. No matter. After carefully drilling out the base to a larger diameter, I just glued in a new 1/4 inch nut with super glue. The fix is holding up so far without problems. We use these scopes year round with our BSA Venture Crew shooting team and they see hard use by the kids. The rubber coating has held up well. I was concerned that the rubber coating would get tacky or deteriorate over time like so many other rubber coated products these days, but the rubber has stayed soft, flexible, tack and crack free.  Amazon stopped carrying these for a while. Glad to see that it's back in inventory.  Update 2 May 2012: The scopes that I already have have held up well. Since my last update, one of the scopes was dropped onto a concrete floor from a height of five feet. The aftermath was a rattling eyepiece and a scope that no longer focuses across the whole field of view. My guess is that the lens mount broke and the lens elements are rattling around in the eyepiece. The repair, if possible, will cost more than the scope is worth so it is now a paperweight.  I've also noted that Amazon's listing for this scope has changed and it is now grouped with other spotting scopes with the same name of Blackhawk but with, presumably, different power and objective lens. Unfortunately, the listing description does not accurately describe the different products.  I just ordered a few more of the lowest priced spotting scopes with the assumption that it is the 18-36x50 that is currently pictured. It'll be interesting to see what I get.  UPDATE 5 OCTOBER 2012:  I've been buying these scopes since 2007 for various youth programs and, overall, have been very happy with them. They have been used at National Junior rifle competitions and the users have won several championships with them. They work. The original ones that I purchased five years ago still function fine. However, I am sad to report that the quality control of this scope had gone downhill. Of the six scopes that I have ordered this year, four had to be returned because of quality control issues related to the front objective lens (the large lens at the front of the scope.)  The objective lens is mounted in an assembly that consists of two threaded rings and an o-ring seal. This assembly is then screwed into the scope body from the front. In more expensive scopes, the lens mount rings are machined from aluminum. On this scope, as in most inexpensive scopes, the mount rings are plastic. This wasn't a problem on the earlier scopes as the plastic was of good quality and held up well. On the latest scopes, the rings are made of more brittle plastic. On two of the scopes that I received, the plastic rings cracked and the lens fell out. On the other two defective scopes, the lens mount was cross threaded in the body of the scope and the objective lens was askew. This made the scope unusable. All four were returned to Amazon.  I contacted an Amazon customer service representative by phone and told her of the situation. After pulling up my shopping history, she immediately authorized a refund to my credit card and e-mailed me a return label for the scopes. She also told me that she would pull the listing, contact their warehouse to pull the product and contact their buyer to work with their supplier to resolve the quality issue. That was two days ago. As I write this, this product is no longer offered by Amazon, although there are other suppliers that continue to sell them on the Amazon website. (Amazon has UNBELIEVABLE customer service! I wish all companies were like this.) I can only hope the manufacturer gets the problem resolved as I have purchased more than 25 of these scopes over the years and only the latest ones have been problematic.  BTW, I also tried to resolve the problem by calling Barska in LaVerne, California and the representative offered to replace the scope under warranty if I shipped it back to them in California (at my cost) and then paid for the shipping back to me (again at my cost). This would have cost me around $40 per scope which is about half of what the scope cost in the first place. I was ready to do this but the representative never sent me the return merchandise authorization (RMA) as she indicated she would. Evidently, Barska's customer service is not to the same standard as Amazon.  As an older guy who has seen the demise of good customer service in America in the last forty years, I have come to fully appreciate Amazon and what they are able to do. Kudos to them. May they live long and prosper."	(Be careful when comparison shopping as many spotting scopes won't focus down this close.)

B0007ZF5JO_21533	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"Ok, i paid 60 bucks for this bike during the reent ""Amazon Customers Vote"" sale and i have to say that it was one heck of a deal for 60 bucks.  There aren't too many bikes that come with this many features, with the Mongoose name, at this price.  The downside though is that because it is shipped, there is a chance that the bike could get damaged as stated by the previous reviewers.  When i received mine everything came out fine except for the rear derailleur, the brakes and the rims.  The rear derailleur was bent so bad that when the chain was on the largest rear sprocket, the derailleur pulley was actually hitting the spokes on the rim!  Anyways, that was resolved by simply taking a crescent wrench to the attachment point on the frame it and bending it back into place.  The brakes desperately needed to be adjusted and both rims had to be trued back so that they were round again.  So whoever buys this bike (or any bike over the internet for that matter) keep in mind that it will NOT be Ready to Ride.  It will definitely need to be ""tuned-up"" and optimized thanks to the rough trip it just had and the likely poor package job it shipped out in.  If you're not ready to do this then i would recommend that you either take the bike to a bike shop and pay them a fee to do it for you, or you just buy your bike from a local shop where this service is typically included in the cost of the bike.  However, if you are willing to do this extra step, then by all means it is one heck of a steal.  Just don't expect to open it up and start riding it around safely in a matter of minutes.  It will probably take a few hours of tweaking at the minimum to get it in tip-top riding condition. So, because of the amount of extra adjustments that needed to be made during assembly i docked the rating 1 star.  I gave it 4 stars for the price."

B00099ZUL6_23034	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I LOVE THIS BOTTLE!!

I have a few for different kinds of shakes/smoothies, one for water at work, one for water at home, and I buy them all the time as gifts for friends. I drink a ton of water and these bottles allow me to have it on hand and not have to leave my desk, meetings, or anywhere else. I pretty much exclusively drink out of these.

B0002DHY4K_44182	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"These have been around a long time.  They are pretty much all I need in a HOB power filter, they move tons of water, the media compartment is roomy, and they come apart easily to clean up if the impeller slows or starts making noise.  The lift tubes can be extended as far as needed with added pieces and the strainer style is good at removing larger debris without clogging too rapidly.  The lift tube is easy enough to pull out and clean off when it is clogged.  Replacement impellers are readily available (and will be eventually needed since these just keep running forever).  The price is appropriate, unlike a lot of power filters now marketed.  A low watt motor attached to a plastic box just shouldn't cost all that much. That said, if you want the ""kit"" , meaning you intend to use the manufacturer's media cartridges, then pass on the Whisper line.  ""Bio-Bag"" cartridges are possibly the worst filter media out there.  The floss bag is thin, poor at filtering finer particles, and needs replacing far too often just to maintain mediocre performance.  As a receptacle for carbon (which you may or may not even care to use) it fails since most of the carbon will be at the bottom of the bag and bypassed anyway.  Without carbon, the bag itself is virtually useless as filter media and the  plastic/fiber ""bio mesh"" is only barely adequate for the size tank this filter is intended. There are clamshell frames available that fit this filter and allow use of your own floss/media.  You can also simply cut some good quality reticulated sponge to size and have a fine filter with permanent mechanical and bio media that simply requires an occasional quick rinse in tank water. I have at least a dozen of these running 24/7, many for several years now, and I've yet to have one quit.*(see below)  They aren't always the quietest, but not bad.  The impellers do get worn and noisy and have to be periodically replaced to quiet it.  For good flow, the right price, and a long life you can't go wrong.  Just don't expect much if you use Tetra's media in them.  02/06/2015 After many years of use I emptied a couple of tanks with one of these filters on each.  Both tanks remained empty and dry for a couple months and when I filled them again and restarted the filters the O-ring seal between the motor and the case completely gave out.  I had pushed the impeller into place a bit forcefully, something I've done many times before without issue but never on a previously dry filter.  What happens is water begins dripping out of the bottom of the filter casing around the small motor and down the cord (and into the wall socket if god forbid you don't have a drip loop).  Potentially a very messy situation since the filter has excellent pull and will continue to bring in water until about half the tank is empty.  I don't consider this a reason to lower the rating since I should have known better than to let any, let alone such an old seal dry out, and if I wanted I could reseal them.  I chose to toss both, they gave me more than my money's worth.  I just wanted to add this heads up to warn anyone as addle brained as I was to not make the same mistake, and to check for any leaking whenever you remove and replace the impeller-intake tube assembly. It's still a fine filter."

783239408_51583	Reviews_movies_tv	Could be the best movie of 1999- And there were a lot of great ones last year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is  saying a LOT, given this  man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think  he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is  about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James  Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky  enough to see a free screening last September and boy, am I glad I had the  privilege...it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you  have trouble even putting your feelings into words.  I rented it over the  weekend and loved it just as much upon second (and 3rd, and 4th, and 5th)  watchings. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to  me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself  as a loser, with Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic  b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the  fact that you can understand why she  turned out this way, with her as a  mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in  the world outside of &quot;Happiness&quot;, you find out about the family  who just moved in next door. At first, the  strange son seems like the most  messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military,  abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase  mother, you realize he  is the most normal member of the household by far.  Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his  daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun,  entertaining,  and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he  is having the most entertaining, hilarious midlife crisis ever seen in the  history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says  anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he  does. I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of  it horrified, amazed laughter at what was happening and the things that are  coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least  a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual  applause and cheers.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. You  think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end.  Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the  events unfold in a  way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you  can see what a character is going to do next, what  violent or  self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.  Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's  theme/tagline of &quot;...look closer&quot;. The characters are not what  they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two  characters  that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something  that turns all your preconceptions of them  upside down, while making your  jaw drop, and your heart ache. All the acting is stunning, but I honestly  can't imagine it being the same movie (or enjoying it as much) with anyone  but Spacey in the lead role. You will leave the movie with a smile, though,  and that is maybe what I expected least of all. Words just cannot do this  movie justice-See it for yourself.

Boris Karloff's depiction here is nothing of the sort! His intensity, and reserved and chilling dignity, give this film an eerie yet intelligent quality that distinguish it amongst the monster genre.This is not a &quot;scare flick,&quot; but an intelligent portrayal of three goals, amongst different characters, which create the conflict: the occult (underrated Egyptian magical arts which only the wisest archaelogist immediately realises are not to be discounted); scientific discovery; a passionate and possessive love that spans millennia. Curiously, these strong impulses all are presented in a surprisingly plausible approach. Though there is nothing gruesome in this film, and children could view it with no undue fear, this is an adult plot, best suited to those who enjoy both intense psychological conflict and the admission that there is much we can never understand.

783243499_54887	Reviews_movies_tv	"I think a lot of reviewers who are trashing this movie are doing so because they have absolutely no understanding of the context in which it is supposed to take place. I know that this is difficult for some people to understand, but because American Psycho is a satire, a COMEDY, it is really key to understand what is being made fun of, what the filmmaker's primary target is, before trashing this and saying you are all upset and disgusted and don't understand and want to cry. Indeed, if you have been living in a bunker for the last 25 years, or were born after the year 2000, you may not be aware of the existence of such ""obscure"" cultural phenomena as: the 80's, New York, yuppieness in general, Wall Street, techno music, cocaine, big hair, prostitution, and exactly why Paul Allen's apartment makes Bateman's heart sink. But that is not the fault of American Psycho. Also, while this movie is obviously a gory and ""twisted"" movie (to use everyone's favorite word) it is ultimately kind of innocent because it's just a joke, it is a big gaffe. Really it is not fair that this movie has 3.5 stars on average; really, the vast majority of negative reviewers of this movie are so undeveloped in their basic comprehension of what is going on here - shocking as that is - that their reviews seem pretty meaningless. That's just my opinion.There are other elemets to the movie as a whole that the nay-sayers seem to pick up on. First and foremost is the actual ambiguity and even veracity of certain events. One interpretation of the film is that for whatever reason, Bateman has slipped into a psychological state where he himself is literally unaware of the events that are depicted in turn.Furthermore, for all of you who complain that this movie is ""sexist"" in that it [encourages] ""violence against women"" I would say that that is a rather shallow interpretation of a pretty brilliant movie that, if you see the bonus features on the DVD, was written and directed by several GLBT women, Guinevere Turner being one of them - one of the best writers around IMHO."

783243499_54838	Reviews_movies_tv	"American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.  But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about ""men behaving badly"" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ...This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor."

783116926_34248	Reviews_movies_tv	Director Peter Medak's THE CHANGELING is a highly entertaining and very creepy old-fashioned ghost story.  It stars award-winning actor George C. Scott as John Russell, a musical composer who still grieves over the tragic deaths of his wife and young daughter (the film opens with the accident in which they are killed).  In an attempt to put the loss behind him and move on with his life, Russell accepts a teaching position and moves to another town, where he also rents a rather dilapidated old mansion.  It doesn't take long for him to realize that his new domicile is haunted, and when he learns that the ghost is that of a young boy who was stealthily murdered in the early 1900s, he throws himself wholeheartedly into the task of solving the mysterious crime.  He is assisted in the endeavor by the real-estate agent who arranged his rental contract, played by Scott's wife Trish Van Devere.This film follows the old-school, Hitchcockian method of sucking the unwitting audience into the fantasy and thereby creating a genuine visceral horror.  Unlike a lot of more contemporary genre fare, THE CHANGELING subtly builds tension by first concentrating on character development.  Then, once the audience has some empathy for the protagonists, the details of the haunting and the related crime slowly unfold as the film's atmosphere becomes more &amp; more eerie and more &amp; more unsettling.  So when the film's scariest events finally take place, the audience has been psychologically primed for being genuinely spooked.The acting in this film is superb.  In contrast to the arrogant, flamboyantly self-assured characters that Scott is generally famous for playing, his John Russell is a sensitive and vulnerable man who seems truly concerned with the plight of others, and Scott delivers an exceptional performance that is just this side of stupendous.  It's a shame that he wasn't offered more roles such as this.  The always beautiful Trish Van Devere does a great turn as the real-estate agent who assists Russell, and she does an especially good job and exuding terror when she is confronted vis-&agrave;-vis by things that go bump in the night.  Also turning in a wonderful performance is the highly revered Melvyn Douglas, here portraying a rather smarmy politician in one of his last roles.  Genre fans will recognize Mr. Douglas from an early performance as Roger Penderel in another spook-house film, James Whale's classic THE OLD DARK HOUSE.Like some of its notable predecessors, this old-fashioned ghost story creates lots of gooseflesh and increases the heart rate without resorting to lots of gratuitous gore or stomach-churning make-up effects.  So keep in mind, then, that fans who prefer only blood-and-guts horror may find THE CHANGELING a bit slow going.  However, anyone who enjoys great acting, great story-telling, and deep-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach psychological scares will really enjoy watching this oft-overlooked gem.	So when the film's scariest events finally take place, the audience has been psychologically primed for being genuinely spooked.The acting in this film is superb.	20:28	1419:1427	The Changeling		scariest		the scariest events	events, ENVIRONMENT=The Changeling	#0=events	scariness	positive	y		
767817648_9584	Reviews_movies_tv	"During the early 1980's, Americans were treated with vehicles that sported the latest futuristic technology.  For cars, there was ""Knight Rider"".  For motorcycles, there was ""Street Hawk"".  And in 1983, people were captivated by a helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".The film was directed by world renown director John Badham (""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""WarGames"") and feature a screenplay by Dan O'Banon (""Alien"" films and ""Total Recall"") and Don Jakoby (""Vampires"" and ""Death Wish 3'), music by Arthur B. Rubinstein (""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Face Value"") and cinematography by John A. Alonzo (""Star Trek: Generations"", ""The Meteor Man"" and ""Internal Affairs"").""BLUE THUNDER"" would star Roy Scheider (""SeaQuest DSV"", ""Jaws"" and ""The French Connection) as LAPD helicopter pilot Officer Frank Murphy.  Together with his new rookie partner Officer Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern), while the two were patroling Los Angeles through the air, they happen to come across on what appeared to be a robbery attempt on city councilwoman Diane McNeely.Unfortunately, before they arrived near the city councilwoman's area, the two were using their helicopter to observe a woman working out nude in her home.  But also, due to previous situations, Officer Frank Murphy is due for a psychological evaluation.  In fact, Murphy tends to use his stop watch to make sure that his mind is thinking straight (despite having nightmares of a Vietnamese soldier being thrown off a helicopter that he was piloting).While meeting with his superior, Captain Jack Braddock (Warren Oates), the LAPD is calling the situation of the councilwoman as a theft and rape incident but Officer Murphy knows that there was no rape but his superior doesn't want to hear anything further from Murphy and relieves both him and Lymangood as pilots for the LAPD temporarily.But the good news for Murphy and Lymangood is that they will be able to test out an advanced helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".  Using the latest in weapons armament and stealth technology, the ""Blue Thunder"" can listen to any conversation as far as 200 ft., armed with machine guns, able to video/audio record outside incidents and also to be tied into various government and law enforcement computers and much more.  The bad news is that the person that is heading the operation for ""Blue Thunder"" is US Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) who is the primary test pilot of the new helicopter.  Both Murphy and Cochrane end up crossing paths and because of their past history, Murphy despises him for a reason unknown.While on the first night testing the ""Blue Thunder"" in Los Angeles, both Murphy and Lymangood are just in awe of the capabilities of the helicopter.  But the two end up using the equipment to spy on Cochrane for the fun of it but what they hear is a shocker.  Because of this, Murphy and Lymangood become a target.  Can Murphy and Lymangood survive long enough to stop the people behind Project THOR?VIDEO & AUDIO:For those who are big fans of ""BLUE THUNDER"", you will be happy to know that the film is given a magnificent transfer on Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1) and having seen this film and having it on VHS and DVD, I can tell you that this is the definitive version to own.For one thing, for a 1983 film, the film just looks great.  The film offers a stark contrast between the day and nighttime sequences and there is a broad spectrum of colors utilized throughout the film.  I didn't notice any significant artifacting, banding or source noise.  I was so happy to see this film not DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and the grain of the film included but not to the point where its too distracting.  There are far many 1980's films that are too soft or too grainy and this film is just right.As for the audio, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is presented with an English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  It's important to emphasize that this film is a 1983 film and can't be compared to today's modern action films.  But  yet, the soundtrack is utilized quite well.  The helicopters rotors spinning, to the echoes of the megaphone, the many explosions and the musical score just coming out quite clear (and loud).  Dialogue remains crisp and clear and overall, there is a good amount of action scenes that utilize the explosions and thus filling the soundstage with automobile and aircraft sounds and machine guns galore.  I was very impressed by the soundtrack for this 26-year-old film.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""BLUE THUNDER"" comes with the following special features (featured in standard definition):* Director, Editor and Motion Control Supervisor Commentary - The Blu-ray includes the 2006 DVD Special Edition commentary featuring Director John Badham, Editor Frank Moriss and motion-control supervisor Hoyt Yeatman.  For those who have never heard of a Badham commentary, Badham is very concise and definitely gives you a peak through his mind of directing and is quite thorough on explaining how this film was created.  It's important to note that these days, a lot of these scenes would be CGI'd but back then, the chase scenes between helicopters were done without CG.  So, it was a challenging and risky film to direct.* ""The Special"": Building Blue Thunder: Making-of the Helicopter - (8:23) Director John Badham, Sydney Z. Litwack (Art Director) and staff from the film discuss the making of the Blue Thunder helicopter and how the concept was created.* Ride With The Angels: Making Blue Thunder - Multi-part Featurette - (44:41) This making of featurette discuss the Director John Badham and his involvement with the film.  Badham and producers talk about the talent they worked with in the film and what they added to the film.  Also, how talented Warren Oates was in the film but passed away a month after the film stopped shooting.  Discussion about the storyboards, Roy Scheider talks about his excitement of riding in the aircraft and Malcolm McDowell's fear of flying.  Also, how a lot of the explosions and destructive scenes were created.* 1983 Promotional Featurette - (8:34) The original 1983 featurette featuring clips from the film, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent of the film.* BD-Live Enabled - For those with Blu-ray players that are Profile 2.0, this Blu-ray disc is BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:When I was younger, I was totally enamored with this film and also the helicopter television shows (""Airwolf"" and ""Blue Thunder"") at the time.  Typically, we never really saw a helicopters as a mean, fighting machine.  But ""BLUE THUNDER"" really gave us a glimpse of modern technology at that time.It has been 26 years since this film came out in the theaters and watching it again, its easy to be shocked of how much of this film featured actual helicopters flying through Los Angeles and of course, how the destruction of parts in Los Angeles was shown through this film.  Surprising because now in Post 9/11, these type of films will never be created in this manner and nor would we see aircraft going at it like this and if it did, it would be CGI.But it's just remarkable to know how much went into the filming of ""Blue Thunder"" without the use of today's modern technology.  How the talents (Scheider and McDowell) actually were in the helicopters being filmed during the air battles and also, the overall destruction of parts of Los Angeles.  There is no way we are ever going to see this type of destruction in this manner in a film, especially how it was created.For the most part, the film shows its age through the various vehicles and clothing styles of the early 80's but the Blu-ray transfer really brings out the detail of the film.  One of the problems of the Special Edition DVD is that the film looked soft and muddy but for the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by its High Definition transfer.  Also, combined with the lossless audio and the fact that audio is a big part of this action film, it made the film much more enjoyable.  And where many 1980's film are devoid of special features for their DVD or Blu-ray release, the good news is that this special edition of ""BLUE THUNDER"" does come with a few hours of special features.Overall, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is an awesome release on Blu-ray.  The release is quite solid with its impressive on HD and its easy to recommend this film but also, I'm quite confident to say that this is the definitive version of ""BLUE THUNDER"" to own at this current time.For fans of this film, this Blu-ray release is definitely recommended!"

076780192X_3556	Reviews_movies_tv	It's a good time to be a sci-fi fan! BetweenBlade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray],2001 - A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray], and this marvelous Close Encounters release, it's an embarrassment of riches. These are some of the best films in the genre, and they're all getting the treatment they deserve on the new high definition format.If you haven't seen the movie in any of its three versions (all of which are available here), no plot summary can do it justice. It's worth a blind purchase based just on its pedigree (Spielberg, fresh off of Jaws, is at his creative peak) and reputation (8 Oscar noms, #64 on the AFI top 100, 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) . If you need to know a little something before jumping in, it's the story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss) who, after witnessing a series of unexplained bright lights, becomes consumed by an obsession with UFOs that tears his family apart. At the same time, a multinational group of scientists investigating a series of mysterious events begin preparations for the first diplomatic visit from extraterrestrials.So the film is a classic. What about the disc? First, this is the only Blu-ray I've come across that doesn't have that cheesy blue plastic top. The packaging is a stylish cardboard slipcase with shiny metallic artwork of a bright light on the horizon. Along with the two discs, which I'll get to in a minute, are a book containing on-set photographs and biographies of the cast & crew, and a poster outlining the differences between the three versions of the film. These are the kind of paper inserts I wish more movies came with instead of worthless lists of chapter titles and ads for other movies. All told, this set looks very nice on the shelf.But how does it look on the screen? Great. Bright lights against a dark sky usually spell disaster for image quality, but everything looks as it should here. Sure, it's noRatatouille [Blu-ray]; there are a few instances when the colors look saturated, but unless you high exceedingly high demands I can't imagine having any complaints. It's certainly the best this film has ever looked!In case you couldn't tell (or are the type of person to skip to the end of a review to get the bottom line recommendation), I highly recommend it.

767839129_15815	Reviews_movies_tv	"This version of Joan of Arc was a complete and utter disgrace. The apparent point of this movie is to depict Joan as completely insane and no real saint.  So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was ""added"" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.One must wonder what kind of corruption is behind this completely soiled and devaluing version of the story of Joan of Arc and this disgraceful depiction of Jesus."

B00JV1294O_284880	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"The heroine was a cat lady!! *fist pump* Heck yeah!! The Taming of the Billionaire was fun, sexy, full of kitties, had a fabulous heroine and one sexy beast of a hero that was a gaming geek to boot. Clare packed all kinds of make-a-girl-squee goodness into The Taming of the Billionaire, that's for sure.  Now. For a while there I was thinking quite a few people in this book needed to be featured in surprise headline making ""bus mows them down"" accidents.  When I finished it...I felt much the same. lol Thankfully the hero redeemed himself and no longer needed to go splat like a couple of the secondary characters.  See. Edie's sister and Magnus's brother want to hook up but her sister claims she has no time because she must be there constantly to help Edie and Magnus's smitten brother refuses to work until he can get with this sister. Which is where Magnus comes into play. To get what he wanted--his brother to buckle down and work on their gaming project-- he went along with their scheme to distract the heroine and pretend to like her so his brother could hook up with her sister, get her out of his system and get back to work! Millions to be made and time is a wasting!  Mmhm. That's where the bus mowing his jerky self down would come into play.  But thankfully he kind of fell for his girl fairly quickly and realized he was a huge, erm, putz to have gone along with the scheme concocted by their siblings.  I actually really loved this one despite the jerkery of some of the characters. Edie was a heroine I totally related to because, hello, I'm a cat lady too! She loves her kitties and helping those in need--she's a feline behaviorist. She struggles with an old injury to her knee that holds her back in a lot of ways and makes her reliant on help from her sister (of the bus mower downee fame), can be downright bitchy--though I kind of loved that too-- and totally embraces getting a little down and dirty.  And Magnus. Well I loved his opposites. He's rich as sin and oh so sexy but he's also a coding nerd and can get lost for hours in the video games he's making. He doesn't always make the best decisions but he's also one that's hard to keep a hate-on for. And when the man grovels...he GROVELS! And does so in a spectacular make a girl cry way. Like. Best grovel ever. How all grovels should go. He is the king of grovelers which made for an amazing end to the book.  They were good together too. Sexy and funny and full of all kinds of yummy passion. Some pretty hot sex scenes too as they spent time together and each wound up both tackling issues with their siblings--him with a slacker brother who was damaging their joint business and her with a manipulative sister that wore the facade of caring giver but really was playing everyone to get what she wanted.  Oh and the kitties. There were LOTS of kitties. I was in kitty heaven! She had 7 of her own in all forms of special needs babies, there's some time as she works as a behaviorist, some rescue time and, well, Magnus becomes a cat dad with multiple chargers and goes from anti-cat to doting kitty lover. It was awesome.  All in all, Taming of the Billionaire was a pretty fun read. Made me growly a couple times over some of the jerky side characters but I really did love the hero and heroine, the romance and one of the best 'big gestures' I've ever read. Clare rocked it and put together a blast of a read that'll leave all cat lovers totally smitten."

I couldn't care less where they are made as long as they work.  These work great.  Their simplicity is their greatest asset...their solid all-metal construction makes them strong, durable, and easy to clean.  The relatively shorter blades and longer handle (i.e., pivot point closer to the sharp end) give good leverage and better control.  Works well for any task from opening a bag of chips to boning a chicken.  The grip is large enough to be comfortable for my male hands, but these are ""righty"" grip only...no ""lefties"" or ambidexterous grips.  While I agree a plastic or silicone grip might be more comfortable to use, the junction with the metal blades would be a perfect place for nasty chicken goo to get stuck.  That's the beauty of these shears...take them apart, wash in hot soapy water, and you're good to go.  I disagree with other commenters on the corrosion and disassembly issues.  Mine are high-carbon stainless (only weakly magnetic...if your shears are very magnetic they probably aren't stainless) and haven't corroded at all through several months of use and washing.  They are polished, not chrome plated which would be prone to flaking off.  The two halves stay together tightly even when fully opened in my hand, but disassemble and reassemble easily each time."

Onions can taste boiled in the pressure cooker so generally I saute them and then lift them out of the oil or butter and set aside for adding later.  The shortened cooking time by no means reduces the flavor of conventional long-cooked recipes.  The shortened cooking times are truly astonishing and absolutely have to translate to a reduction in your energy bill.  The cooker cooks at such low temperatures that my electric burner just barely achieves that low a temperature.  I was a little nervous about the concept in my first go-around, but that vanishes fast.  My Sitram cookware is collecting dust!

B00004RFRV_10752	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I love this little stovetop espresso maker! It makes a delicious cup of coffee. Follow the directions and it works perfectly. I use about 24 grams of coffee beans for each brew, ground just above the finest setting on my grinder, slightly tamping it down with my finger. With a little lower than medium setting on the gas stove, the coffee begins to stream out of the middle post at 5 minutes. Works perfectly every time. I can set a timer to 5 minutes and not have to watch the pot for it to brew. I have used this to make an iced latte, too. I add the sugar to the pot so it dissolves as the hot coffee fills the upper compartment. I let it set and cool for a bit, then add cold milk and ice. Its as good as any coffee shop iced latte Ive purchased, and a lot cheaper! Very happy with this purchase. I think Im going to purchase the larger version of this so I can make more at a time.

B00004RDFW_9375	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I looked at a few ravioli/pierogi makers before settling on these. I've been really excited about trying to make pierogi and ravioli and I liked that it had 4 different sizes. I got them and noticed that the largest one was cracked on the hinge..it wasn't completely broken, and I didn't want to wait and send them back for a new set..I wanted to make pierogi now!  The plastic is cheap and rigid, easy to break. I thought for almost ten dollars they would have made them a little better. My first attempt at pierogi ended up breaking the biggest size (the one I received cracked). The smaller ones held up, but as cheaply made as these are, I can't see the rest lasting 3 months. My biggest issue is with the price. 9-10 dollars for these is absolutely ridiculous. They shouldn't be more than 4.00. The plastic is akin to dollar store plastic...or mcdonalds toys plastic. Not what I expected when I bought them. Im happy I got to make pierogi...not happy that my biggest size broke..I had also planned on making some hand pies and calzones. If there had been an option for stainless steel with the various sizes I think I would've went with that, but none were available. Just be warned that you're spending 9-10 dollars on something that MIGHT last you 2-3 months (if you're lucky) before breaking.

So I thought this ""pure vanilla powder"" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods.  Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract.  It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too.  It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract,  and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly).

I have no problem sprinting down the court, jumping, or changing direction. However, there is a certain level of discomfort, at least in my case. After a hard indoor game or a few hours of playing outside, I do find my feet being pretty sore and tired. The front of my toes hurt, and the arch of my foot feels exhausted (I did not have this problem with other shoes in the same size, although they had less explosive capabilities).  I would say these are good in-game shoes. If you want shoes to just shoot around, practice, or maybe to play in the street for a few hours, I would say these shoes wouldn't be the wisest choice. However, if you play in an indoor league these shoes provide the support and resistance to perform well in-game.  Summary: Strong, durable shoe. Great for indoor game(s), not ideal for everyday practice. Good game shoes for the price. 4 stars.

These are some of the most experienced, versatile, and forward thinking people in the web world.  They are helping people to see that designing for a desktop computer is a thing of the past, for mobile communication happens nowadays on devices as small as a watch and as large as an entire wall.  From their web site at [...]    Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity of connected devices--many of which we haven't imagined yet--will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them.   Our existing standards, workflows, and infrastructure won't hold up. Today's onslaught of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They can't withstand what's ahead.   Proprietary solutions will dominate at first. Innovation necessarily precedes standardization. Technologists will scramble to these solutions before realizing (yet again) that a standardized platform is needed to maintain sanity.   The standards process will be painfully slow. We will struggle with (and eventually agree upon) appropriate standards. During this period, the web will fall even further behind proprietary solutions.  A New Hope  But there's hope.

The yellow is a lovely buttery shade and the fabric is not cheap-looking at all (which I was concerned about at this price! ). Please do listen to the other reviews with regard to sizing though.... I did not, and ordered her usual size (a 14, she is 11 and 5'0"" & 98 lbs) and it was probably a whole size too large.

Guide_1290_29	literature	Though the planet Earth , the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished , it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty -nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued . 9 A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason . This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch . A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy . It was exactly a nothingth of a second long , a nothingth of an inch wide , and quite a lot of million light years from end to end . As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe . A team of seven threefoot- high market analysts fell out of it and died , partly of asphyxication , partly of surprise . Two hundred and thirty - nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too , materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the Pansel system . The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later . The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion . Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns . These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves ( this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns ) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to .

Hobbit_978_9	literature	"Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing . Dwarves had not passed that way for many years , but Gandalf had , and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the Wild , since the dragons had driven men from the lands , and the goblins had spread in secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria . Even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild ; and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it . He knew that something unexpected might happen , and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled . They did not . All was well , until one day they met a thunderstorm - more than a thunderstorm , a thunder-battle . You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river-valley ; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash . More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night , when storms come up from East and West and make war . The lightning splinters on the peaks , and rocks shiver , and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow ; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light . Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind . They were high up in a narrow place , with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them . There they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night , and he lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe . When he peeped out in the lightning -flashes , he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out and were hurling rocks at one another for a. game , and catching them , and tossing them down into the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below , or splintered into little bits with a bang . Then came a wind and a rain , and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction , so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all . Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between their legs , and some of them were whinnying with fright . They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides . "" This wo n't do at all ! "" said Thorin . "" If we do n't get blown off or drowned , or struck by lightning , we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football . "" "" Well , if you know of anywhere better , take us there ! "" said Gandalf , who was feeling very grumpy , and was far from happy about the giants himself . The end of their argument was that they sent Fill and Kili to look for a better shelter . They had very sharp eyes , and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs ( when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo ) .

Hobbit_1766_38	literature	" Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess .  He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows , as he said this , and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out . Then he had questions of his own to ask , for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves , Bilbo had not heard it . He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again , and where they had all got to now . The wizard , to tell the truth , never minded explaining his cleverness more than once , so now he had told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains . But their main gate used to come out on a different pass , one more easy to travel by , so that they often caught people benighted near their gates . Evidently people had given up going that way , and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken , quite recently , because it had been found quite safe up to now . "" I must see if I ca n't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again , "" said Gandalf , "" or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all . "" As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo 's yell he realized what had happened . In the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the crack , just as it snapped to . He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall , and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the shadows . "" A very ticklish business , it was , "" he said . "" Touch and go ! "" But , of course , Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights ( even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took 's midsummer - eve parties , as you remember ) . The rest we all know - except that Gandalf knew all about the back - door , as the goblins called the lower gate , where Bilbo lost his buttons . As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains ; but it took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right direction . "" They made that gate ages ago , "" he said , "" partly for a way of escape , if they needed one ; partly as a way out into the lands beyond , where they still come in the dark and do great damage . They guard it always and no one has ever managed to block it up . They will guard it doubly after this , "" he laughed . All the others laughed too . After all they had lost a good deal , but they had killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides , and they had all escaped , so they might be said to have had the best of it so far . But the wizard called them to their senses . "" We must be getting on at once , now we are a little rested , "" he said ."

Hobbit_1910_10	literature	"Then another came and another , one in blue flames , one in red , another in green . They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke . A specially large one hit the chief wolf on the nose , and he leaped in the air ten feet , and then rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright . The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered . The rage of the wolves was terrible to see , and the commotion they made filled all the forest . Wolves are afraid of fire at all times , but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire . If a spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into them , and unless they rolled over quick they were soon all in flames . Very soon all about the glade wolves were rolling over and over to put out the sparks on their backs , while those that were burning were running about howling and setting others alight , till their own friends chased them away and they fled off down the slopes crying and yammering and looking for water . "" What 's all this uproar in the forest tonight ? "" said the Lord of the Eagles . He was sitting , black in the moonlight , on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains . "" I hear wolves ' voices ! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods ? "" He swept up into the air , and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at either hand leaped up to follow him . They circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the Wargs , a tiny spot far far below . But eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at a great distance . The lord of the eagles of the Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking , and could see a rabbit moving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight . So though he could not see the people in the trees , he could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire , and hear the howling and yelping come up faint from far beneath him . Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and helmets , as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from their gate and wound into the wood . Eagles are not kindly birds . Some are cowardly and cruel . But the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds ; they were proud and strong and noble-hearted . They did not love goblins , or fear them . When they took any notice of them at all ( which was seldom , for they did not eat such creatures ) , they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves , and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing ."

The bark caught fire , the lower branches cracked . Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree . The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning , as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins . That would have been the end of him , though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt . But he never leaped . Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above , seized him in his talons , and was gone . There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins . Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles , to whom Gandalf had now spoken . Back swept the great birds that were with him , and down they came like huge black shadows . The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth ; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage , and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain . Over them swooped the eagles ; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away ; their talons tore at goblin faces . Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves , who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go . Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again !

Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called to them . They heard his voice come faintly : "" Good- bye ! Be good , take care of yourselves - and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH ! "" Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight . "" O good - bye and go away ! "" grunted the dwarves , all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing him . Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey . They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water - skin which was their share , and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest . Chapter 8 . Flies and Spiders They walked in single file . The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together , too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves . The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks . Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind , and the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened . As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer . Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above , and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath , stabbed down thin and bright before them . But this was seldom , and it soon ceased altogether . There were black squirrels in the wood . As Bilbo 's sharp inquisitive eyes got used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree-trunks . There were queer noises too , grunts , scufflings , and hurryings in the undergrowth , and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick in places on the forest-floor ; but what made the noises he could not see . The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs : dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick , often stretched from tree to tree , or tangled in the lower branches on either side of them . There were none stretched across the path , but whether because some magic kept it clear , or for what other reason they could not guess . It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the goblins , and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending ."

Hobbit_2647_16	literature	"Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm , and Bombur ( still grumbling ) was getting ready to follow , when something bad did happen . There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead . Out of the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer . It charged into the dwarves and bowled them over , then gathered itself for a leap . High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump . But it did not reach the other side in safety . Thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits . As soon as they had landed he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared . Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast . As it reached the further bank it stumbled . The shadows swallowed it up , but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still . Before they could shout in praise of the shot , however , a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds . "" Bombur has fallen in ! Bombur is drowning ! "" he cried . It was only too true . Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him , and sprang over him . He had stumbled , thrusting the boat away from the bank , and then toppled back into the dark water , his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge , while the boat span slowly off and disappeared . They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank . Quickly they flung a rope with a hook towards him . His hand caught it , and they pulled him to the shore .

Hobbit_2895_1	literature	"Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop , and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody . Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place , but several of the spiders had run now to different points in the glade where they lived , and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree-stems . Very soon the hobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round him - that at least was the spiders ' idea . Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his courage and began a new song : [ vs ] With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had been closed with a web - but luckily not a proper web , only great strands of double - thick spider- rope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to trunk . Out came his little ' sword . He slashed the threads to pieces and went off singing . The spiders saw the sword , though I do n't suppose they knew what it was , and at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches , hairy legs waving , nippers and spinners snapping , eyes popping , full of froth and rage . They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as he dared . Then quieter than a mouse he stole back . He had precious little time , he knew , before the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees where the dwarves were hung . In the meanwhile he had to rescue them . The worst part of the job was getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling . I do n't suppose he would have managed it , if a spider had not luckily left a rope hanging down ; with its help , though it stuck to his hand and hurt him , he scrambled up - only to meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the prisoners , and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat . It had thought of starting the feast while the others were away , but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry , and before the spider knew what was happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch dead . Bilbo 's next job was to loose a dwarf . What was he to do ? If he cut the string which hung him up , the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below . Wriggling along the branch ( which made all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit ) he reached the first bundle . "" Fili or Kili , "" he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top . "" Most likely Fili , "" he thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding threads . He managed by leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that bound him round , and then , sure enough , with a kick and a struggle most of Fili emerged . I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on the spider-string under his armpits , just like one of those funny toys bobbing on a wire ."

Hobbit_3017_21	literature	It was a terrible shock . Of course there were only thirteen of them , twelve dwarves and the hobbit . Where indeed was Thorin ? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him , magic or dark monsters ; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest . There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams , as evening wore to black night ; and there we must leave them for the present , too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching . Thorin had been caught much faster than they had . You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep , as he stepped into a circle of light ? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward , and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted . All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night , their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them , and all the sounds of the battle next day , had passed over him unheard . Then the Wood-elves had come to him , and bound him , and carried him away . The feasting people were Wood-elves , of course . These are not wicked folk . If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers . Though their magic was strong , even in those days they were wary . They differed from the High Elves of the West , and were more dangerous and less wise . For most of them ( together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains ) were descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West . There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages , and grew fairer and wiser and more learned , and invented their magic and their cunning craft , in the making of beautiful and marvellous things , before some came back into the Wide World . In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon but loved best the stars ; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost . They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods , from which they could escape at times to hunt , or to ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight ; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk . Still elves they were and remain , and that is Good People . In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at this time their greatest king . Before his huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands . This great cave , from which countless smaller ones opened out on every side , wound far underground and had many passages and wide halls ; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin-dwelling , and neither so deep nor so dangerous .

Hobbit_3317_9	literature	"It was already grey morning , and there was a merry racket down by the river . They were making up a raft of barrels , and the raft-elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake-town . Bilbo sneezed again . He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over . He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in time to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle . Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow , and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while . There was a mighty pushing of poles . The elves that were standing in the shallow . water heaved and shoved . The barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted . . "" This is a heavy load ! "" some grumbled . "" They float too deep - some of these are never empty . If they had come ashore in the daylight , we might have had a look inside , "" they said . "" No time now ! "" cried the raftman . "" Shove off ! "" And off they went at last , slowly at first , until they had passed the point of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles , and then quicker and quicker as they caught the main stream and went sailing away down , down towards the Lake . They had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood , but whether alive or dead still remains to be seen . Chapter 10 .

The dragon rolled over . "" Look ! "" he said . "" What do you say to that ? "" "" Dazzlingly marvellous ! Perfect ! Flawless ! Staggering !

"" After he had seen that Mr. Baggins ' one idea was to get away . "" Well , I really must not detain Your Magnificence any longer , "" he said , "" or keep you from much needed rest . Ponies take some catching , I believe , after a long start . And so do burglars , "" he added as a parting shot , as he darted back and fled up the tunnel . It was an unfortunate remark , for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him , and fast though he sped up the slope , he had not gone nearly far enough to be comfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the opening behind . Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in , but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him , and he was nearly overcome , and stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear . He had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug , but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense . "" Never laugh at live dragons , Bilbo you fool !

Beside it ran a stone - paved road , wide enough for many men abreast . Swiftly along this they ran , and round a wide-sweeping turn - and behold ! before them stood the broad light of day . In front there rose a tall arch , still showing the fragments of old carven work within , worn and splintered and blackened though it was . A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain , and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold . A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over them ; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon . Now before them the water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley . They flung their pale torches to the ground , and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes . They were come to the Front Gate , and were looking out upon Dale . "" Well ! "" said Bilbo , "" I never expected to be looking OUT of this door . And I never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again , and to feel the wind on my face . But , ow ! this wind is cold ! "" It was . A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter . It swirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley , and sighed among the rocks .

Gatsby_56_13	literature	I lived at West Egg , the — well , the less fashionable of the two , though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them . My house was at the very tip of the egg , only fifty yards from the Sound , and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season . The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy , with a tower on one side , spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy , and a marble swimming pool , and more than forty acres of lawn and garden . It was Gatsby ’s mansion . Or , rather , as I did n’t know Mr. Gatsby , it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name . My own house was an eyesore , but it was a small eyesore , and it had been overlooked , so I had a view of the water , a partial view of my neighbour ’s lawn , and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month . Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water , and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans . Daisy was my second cousin once removed , and I ’d known Tom in college . And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago . Her husband , among various physical accomplishments , had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven — a national figure in a way , one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty -one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax .

It was Mr. Klipspringer , the “ boarder . ” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning . Finally we came to Gatsby ’s own apartment , a bedroom and a bath , and an Adam ’s study , where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall . He had n’t once ceased looking at Daisy , and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well - loved eyes . Sometimes too , he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way , as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real . Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs . His bedroom was the simplest room of all — except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold .

r50_3_3	TNE_dev	"Radical Group declares Tsunami punishment from God  January 3, 2005   The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), known for its radical anti-homosexual statements, has founded a website following the Asian Tsunami disaster targeting Sweden. It is the most recent in a string of websites formed by his followers, including ones against Canada, United States, and their original website, godhatesfags.com, campaigning against homosexuals.  The anti-Swede website — godhatessweden.com — proclaims ""thank God for 5,000 dead Swedes"" and indicates that the church members ""pray for all 20,000 Swedes missing in the Tsunami's wake to be declared dead."" The website also links to a recording of a recent sermon by Reverend Phelps and a flyer containing the church's official position. The flyer is a caricature of a devil with small signs declaring that Sweden is a ""Homo-fascist state"" and a ""damned land of ... Sodomites"".  The WBC's outcries against Sweden seem to stem from the arrest of Pastor Ake Green by Swedish authorities for describing homosexuals as ""a horrible cancerous tumour in the body of society""."

The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, causing a bottleneck. Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them.  Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes, if physically or financially possible, as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith.

Methamphetamine is a growing problem, nearly double what it was three years ago in many regions. Over the last three years, 88 percent of counties have experienced an increase of meth-related crimes. Regions reporting the largest growth include the Upper Midwest, Southwest, and the Northwest - all reported a 93 percent increase in meth-related arrests. The Lower Midwest came in a close second with arrests increasing by 90 percent.  Meth labs use highly flammable and explosive materials to produce the drug. Due to this, meth labs have been known to explode in spectacularly devastating events.

17	dailydialogue_dev_1	X-- I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . Y-- Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . X-- Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . Y-- Do you sell direct to shops ? X-- Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . Y-- Do you keep a stock of these things ? X-- In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . Y-- That is , your commission . X-- Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . Y-- Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . X-- The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . Y-- According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? X-- We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . Y-- We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... X-- Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? Y-- Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . X-- Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . Y-- Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . X-- Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? Y-- Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . X-- All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . Y-- Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__ 	Mr .

10	dailydialogue_test	X-- Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? Y-- Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . X-- Yeah , that's very important . Y-- So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . X-- I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . Y-- That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . X-- It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . Y-- It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . X-- But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . Y-- I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . X-- It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . Y-- You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . X-- I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . Y-- You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . X-- It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . Y-- It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__ 	I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .	13:18	612:617			best	4	"TRY(e, AGENT=x, EVENTUALITY=MAKE_IMPRESSION(e, AGENT=X, EXPERIENCER=the interviewer)_0, MANNER=""my best"")"	TRY(e, AGENT=x, EVENTUALITY=MAKE_IMPRESSION(e, AGENT=X, EXPERIENCER=the interviewer)_0, MANNER=*)	#0=e	quality	positive	n
