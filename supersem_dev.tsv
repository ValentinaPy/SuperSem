05-072_Psychology_213	wikipedia	In the same way Jane Goodall studied the role of chimpanzee social and family life, psychologists conduct similar observational studies in human social, professional and family lives.  Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed and other times it is covert, the participants do not know they are being observed.  Ethical guidelines need to be taken into consideration when covert observation is being carried out.  Online surveys are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, or checking the validity of experimental manipulations.

05-080_Seiche_7	wikipedia	"The key requirement for formation of a seiche is that the body of water be at least partially bounded, allowing natural phenomena to form a standing wave.  The term was first promoted by the Swiss hydrologist François-Alphonse Forel in 1890, who had observed the effect in Lake Geneva, Switzerland.  The word originates in a Swiss French dialect word that means ""to sway back and forth"", which had apparently long been used in the region to describe oscillations in alpine lakes.  Seiches are often imperceptible to the naked eye, and observers in boats on the surface may not notice that a seiche is occurring due to the extremely long wavelengths.  The effect is caused by resonances in a body of water that has been disturbed by one or more of a number of factors, most often meteorological effects (wind and atmospheric pressure variations), seismic activity or by tsunamis."

05-080_Seiche_58	wikipedia	The natural resonant period of Hilo Bay is about thirty minutes.  That meant that every second wave was in phase with the motion of Hilo Bay, creating a seiche in the bay.  As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the tsunami/seiche reaching a height of 14 m and killing 159 inhabitants.  Seiche waves may continue for several days after a tsunami.  Although the bulk of the technical literature addresses surface seiches which are most readily observed, seiches are also observed beneath the lake surface acting along the thermocline in constrained bodies of water.

Over 5000 Egyptian antiquities were donated to the museum in 1867 by Joseph Mayer (1803-1886), a local goldsmith and antiquarian.  Mayer purchased collections from Joseph Sams of Darlington (which contained material from the Henry Salt sale in 1835), Lord Valentia, Bram Hertz and the Reverend Henry Stobart.  Mayer had displayed his collection in his own ‘Egyptian Museum’ in Liverpool with a purpose of giving citizens who were unable to visit the British Museum in London some idea of the achievements of the Egyptian civilization.  On the strength of this substantial donation other people began to donate Egyptian material to the museum, and by the later years of the nineteenth century the museum had a substantial collection that Amelia Edwards described as being the most important collection of Egyptian antiquities in England next to the contents of the British Museum.

04-034_History_of_biology_253	wikipedia	marked another watershed in the history of modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis.  Coupled with the use of expressed sequence tags, PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.  The unity of much of the morphogenesis of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the homeobox genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans.  These developments led to advances in the field of evolutionary developmental biology towards understanding how the various body plans of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.  The Human Genome Project - the largest, most costly single biological study ever undertaken - began in 1988 under the leadership of James D. Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans.

04-035_History_of_cartography_166	wikipedia	In China, the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th century BC, during the beginning of the Warring States (481 BC - 221 BC).  This was the 'Yu Gong' ('Tribute of Yu') chapter of the book  Shu Jing  (Classic of History).  The book describes the traditional nine provinces, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly.  The nine provinces in the time of this geographical work was very small in terrain size compared to what modern China occupies today.

Crokinole is often believed to be of Mennonite or Amish origins, but there is no factual data to support such a claim.  The reason for this misconception may be due to its popularity in Mennonite and Amish sects.  The game was viewed as a rather innocuous pastime - unlike the perception that diversions such as card playing or dancing were 'works of the Devil' as held by many 19th century Protestant groups.  The oldest roots of crokinole from the 1860s suggest the British and South Asian games are the most likely antecedents of what became crokinole.

Even channels that appear to be straight have a sinuous thalweg that leads eventually to a sinuous channel.  In the equilibrium theory, meanders decrease the stream gradient until an equilibrium between the erodability of the terrain and the transport capacity of the stream is reached.  A mass of water descending must give up potential energy, which, given the same velocity at the end of the drop as at the beginning, is removed by interaction with the material of the stream bed.  The shortest distance; that is, a straight channel, results in the highest energy per unit of length, disrupting the banks more, creating more sediment and aggrading the stream.

02-102_Venezuela_43	wikipedia	Much of Venezuela's nineteenth century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule.  During first half of the 20th century,  (military strongmen) continued to dominate, though they generally allowed for mild social reforms and promoted economic growth.  Following the death of Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935 and the demise of caudillismo (authoritarian rule), pro-democracy movements eventually forced the military to withdraw from direct involvement in national politics in 1958.  Since that year, Venezuela has had a series of democratically elected governments.  The discovery of massive oil deposits, totaling some 400 million barrels, during World War I prompted an economic boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita GDP was Latin America's highest, and globalization and heavy immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.

03-059_Midwifery_52	wikipedia	Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs.  The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin.  Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom.  It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives.  Slave girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.

B0002BJQDY_123852	Reviews_Video_Games	"When I first played Guild Wars I was absolutely extatic about it. I played one day for over eight hours. This was a few months ago and I have now since finished the game with one character and am currently on my 7th character. I wrote a review back then stating that Guild Wars was the best game ever and badmouthed people who played WOW. However, after the large update and countless trips to that new area the game absolutely bored me to death. In any case here are the pros and cons of Guild Wars:  The single greatest aspect most would contend is the fact that online gameplay is free. This brings many to the table who had not experienced an online RPG (myself included) and other owners of MMORPG's who were tired of paying to keep these companies servers running. The most obvious question is how do the guilds work? Well, basically a guild can be formed and you can give it your own unique name as well as a cape both with fairly small fees. To the best of my knowledge you can have as many people as you want in your guild. Likewise you are allowed to purchase a guild hall where members of the guild can meet and from there do multiplayer called guild vs. guild or player vs. player.  Guild Wars has stunning visuals in my opinion; given of course you have at least a fairly contemporary graphics card and the memory to back it up with. You are allowed four characters per account and of course the ability to creat the look and class of your player. The classes in this game are warrior, monk, necromancer, ranger, elementalist, and mesmer. Weapons and armor are greatly varied with armor sets ranging anywhere from 1500 gold to over 1 million gold. Another plus is that the makers of GW plan on bringing out Guild Wars: Chapter 2 in the middle of 2006 which is purported to contain a whole new class of character from which to chose and a new map. This is will be a full expansion pack, so those who are getting bored with the current game won't have to wait too long.  Now the weapons will be discussed in detail. There are five different weapon types according to their value; these are white, blue, purple, green, and gold. These are listed in least to greatest value respectively. Certain gold weapons and focus items can go for millions of gold. Just to let you get an idea of how much that is--most players in guild wars have less than 10,000 gold in their accounts. Each class has only a few types of weapons that can be used ideally. Each type of weapon also has a maximum damage it can deal on a foe. Warriors can wield two general types of weapons that deal blunt damage or slashing damage. Blunt damage weapons are two handed and swords/sickles/axes are one handed. Rangers always use bows. The other four classes all use either a one handed magic rod or wand or a two handed staff. Any two handed weapon in Guild Wars can be upgraded. Weapons essentially are the driving force of the virtual economy of Guild Wars and at the same time one of the greatest downfalls in it.  The folllowing negative parts of Guild Wars are seen through my eyes, but I played the game for some 625 hours over the course of four months. so the gripes I feel are very warranted. The first real problem I see is not the game itself, but the infrastructure and community is the number of children and supremely immature people playing the game. People will cuss you out because you didn't offer them the price they were looking for on a weapon or offhand item or others can get angry just because of the lack of teamwork. Most of the time these squabbles end in one person attempting to use as many four letter words as possible. I was actually called a f**ktard by someone. Fights over teamwork go on a lot because to beat the game you have to know how to work together very well. In fact, I would say at least half of the people that play Guild Wars have no idea how to work as a group. However, if you desire to play the game solo sometimes you are better off playing with the henchmen. They do attack what you attack as long as you call out your target. Playing with henchmen lends to the idea that it could just as easily have been turned into a completely offline game. Anyhow, this is most likely the greatest factor in my stopping playing the game.  Another gargantuan downside to GW is the virtual market which is 99% people driven. Obviously those at Anet were going for this. Unfortunately, prices are driven up just because a certain weapon is rare and is not entirely based on the quality of the weapon. This creates great tension between those who claim to know how much a weapon is and those who are going off of what they believe to be the correct price. The real question is where do these values come from? Is there an Alan Greenspan within Guild wars who changes the prices from day to day? My suggested solution to this is to have a true value weapons shop so there would be no debate. Along with this, some people end up paying real money to buy these ""rare"" weapons or items on websites.  A terribly large controversy within the community of this game is the level cap, which is placed at level 20. Some will say this allows for more interesting multiplayer and you don't have to spend years building up your character just to fight in the arenas. The counter-argument is that once you have reached level 20 (which isn't very difficult) you have nothing left to achieve other than gaining new skills. I'm not even going to go into the ""powerleveling"" argument, because that's all a matter of opinion if you would rather be rewarded for countless hours you have spent playing this game or essentially gain nothing past level 20. Since there is a level cap, certain areas of the game are nearly impossible or completely impossible to reach without the use of a warrior with many defensive and speed skills (referred to as a runner).  Lastly here are some smaller things that bother me about the game: The game is not very interactive for a supposed MMORPG. Essentially you have eight slots in which you can put your various skills and you can change your weapons and armor. A true MMORPG allows you to be in the same place as any other player anywhere on the map, not just in cities. The landscape is downright annoying at times. You cannot walk up mountains or even larger hills, so some parts resemble more of a labyrinth. Overall gameplay can get tedious especially after playing as much as I have. In conclusion, is Guild Wars worth buying? In short-yes, but only if you really want to play an online rpg for free. I must warn you it is very addictive for a while and will keep you from sleep and people. There are other role-playing games out there that I believe are superior to Guild Wars. Guild Wars is revolutionary, but flawed. Overall I give Guild Wars a 7 out of 10."

B000930DIM_138889	Reviews_Video_Games	So I'm a huge fan of Burnout: Takedown, and I'm initially eyeing this release as suspect - it's either going to be the same game, or they're going to add some new element that's going to suck.  But no, basically they've made the best arcade racer, ever.  While Takedown gave you a sense of speed, this game makes you feel like wetting your pants. It feels so fast, it's crazy.  The additions to the race modes (traffic attack and racing with the detonation feature active during aftertouch) work well. Being able to slam into traffic from the rear was a bit hokey to me for about 11 seconds, then it was just that much more coolness thrown on top of everything.  I'm giving this game 4 stars ont he PS2 platform, as the music just outright blah blah blah - it's largely unimportant, at least takedown had a track or two that stood out. Unlike the XBox version, you can't have your own tracks, so you either turn it off or you're stuck listening to it.

I stitched on edge binding and used tiny rare-earth magnets every two inches.  This screen was very easy to cut and sew.  The rough cut edges were not sharp or raveling.  The completed window screen is about 70"" long and 15"" high.  It rolls up very nicely (the magnets are strong enough to hold the roll together).  The screen material is flexible and smooth to the touch.  Despite the almost fabric-like handling of the screen material, it is very durable and I have not had even the tiniest tear-out or malformation from handling.

I am a current graduate student and sometimes have evening classes. It is nice to have this flashlight on me when I'm walking back to my car in the dark. It is super light and thin just like a pen, hence the name ""pen flashlight"". I can barely feel it in my pocket and I bring it with me everywhere. It is super bright, brighter than I expected. The pen flashlight feels sturdy and durable. I like how it can do momentary light by lightly pressing the button. I love this light and even bought some for a friend who works at campus security. He says he loves it a lot! He loves the momentary light option on it the most. Overall I think this is a brilliant light and is perfect for everyday carry.

B00008BFS6_24199	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	This is my 3rd one.  Love these things, especially when I get them for less then $19 US.  I have to pay over $30 retail where I live.  The same retailer wants $19 for just 2 of the Quad A batteries, it doesn't take a math genius to figure why I buy from Amazon.  I took off one star because the plastic sheath (the weakest point in my opinion) keeps cracking.  I wonder if anyone thought of going silicon in this area?  Of all flashlights I own, this one is used most often by far.  Could be just the trade I'm in, electrical, it works great for peering into the nooks and crannies where wires and connections come loose or screws and nuts fall.

B000HZI6F4_89897	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I bought this compressor to replace a husky 26 gallon compressor that died on me after 2 weeks of moderate usage.  Don't be fooled by its size, this compressor packs a much larger punch than I was anticipating it to.  Holds its air well, charges to well over 210psi.  Before I really new anything about compressors and what the most important factor is being the scfm rating I was foolish in thinking bigger was better.  This unit sits nicely in our garage along side of 2 cars, its much quieter than my husky was and requires no special wiring or plumbing to operate.  Plug it in and it's good to go.  Perfect for the weekend warrior.  As far as the made in china comments are concerned, ive learned to deal with it as sadly its a part of reality now... I envision a lot of empty houses and garages from the people who refuse to buy the made in china lol.  Bottom line, I'd recommend it as it hasn't failed me yet through an auto body paint job that I just recently completed involving priming, base coat, clear coat, and many auto parts being stripped off and reassembled via impact and air ratchet.  :D	Before I really new anything about compressors and what the most important factor is being the scfm rating I was foolish in thinking bigger was better.	61:65	328:332	DEWALT D55168 225 PSI 15 Gallon 120-Volt Electric Wheeled Portable Workshop Compressor		most		scfm rating	factors, ENVIRONMENT=compressors	factors	importance	positive	n

B00067YO9U_44785	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	First off, Let's have a round of Applause for Westinghouse Engineers!  Yay!!!  This was the BEST EVER install I've experienced! I've moved many times in 35 yrs, and always install ceiling fans into my new homes, so I've done MANY, of many brands. This was BY FAR the fastest, easiest, install I've ever done. Thank you Westinghouse. I never even needed my husband to do this one. That T-bar design is Fantastic.  All you do is screw the first cross bar to the electrical box in the ceiling (weight = couple ounces, 2 screws). Then the motor housing has a cross bar on it, that has a T in one end. It slides into the first cross bar slot, and lets the housing dangle while you tie up the wires, then it's just a simple pivot up, & 3 screws to hold it to the first cross bar. SOOOO easy, and no weightlifters needed. I'm a 55+ woman, & I did this with gleeful ease. Also, there's a TON of room for the wiring. I was all ready for the usual wrestling match of squishing wire nuts into the box, while simultaneously wrestling the housing into place, but no need! YAY! I didn't even try,  at first, but then one dropped down and touched the fan motor, so I did have to push it up out of the way after testing.  It was ticking, but once the wire was out of the way, all was well. Yay.  Side NOTE:  If you were thinking about installing a remote, this housing has PLENTY of room for one. We paid a hundred bucks extra for a fan with a remote built in, based on past experience with fans, knowing there's no way an added remote box would fit in there, but I have no doubt it would fit in this, with room to spare. (I'm just contemplating returning the remote fan I haven't installed yet, to switch to this one, and Add my own, for $20-40. more.)  PROS: *  INSTALL = Genius! Someone who actually installs these things finally was consulted in the design. YAY. *  Metal housing, metal hardware, & a nice brushed nickel finish. *  Excellent air movement. It's a much smaller fan than I've used in the past, and worked better than I'd imagined. *  The lights installed easily, frosted finish is nice to cut glare, & open globes make light bulb changes easy. *  Solid as a rock. NO wobble at all. Smooth run on the fan itself. *  Looks good, and doesn't overpower the whole bedroom, visually.  CONS:  *  The fan blades & holders are lesser quality than many I've seen. From the floor, you likely wouldn't notice, but as you install, you'll notice, especially if you do a lot of these. They're lighter in weight, and the edges aren't as smooth as in a more expensive fan. With the fan running, no one could tell, and at this price point, I'm not complaining. *  They used fabric washers - only on the fan blades, instead of metal or rubber ones. Not sure why, but they don't show, and as long as they stay put, I really don't care. First time seeing this, so maybe it's a biggie to you. No issues for me, so far. Will update, if it becomes an issue later on down the road.  Final note:   The Lights take Candelabra light bulbs only. THANK CONGRESS for this - NOT the manufacturers. CONGRESS passed a LAW that they can ONLY use the tiny bulbs in ALL ceiling fans, ALL brands, so there's no getting around that. They do sell adapters, to step up to the bigger bulbs, but try it, before you do that. I was furious when I first discovered this law, but found that the tiny bulbs are putting out enough light for the bedrooms, so unless it's for a kitchen, you may find they do shine well enough. I hate the tiny bulbs, and Congress, but I got over this particular issue, and have accepted it.	First off, Let's have a round of Applause for Westinghouse Engineers!  Yay!!!

B000ZROSCO_140684	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	Even though it has two sizable computer cooling fans, the maximum airflow may not be more than your current register blows.  And it was my case.  As a result, the fan only added noise but did not improve flow any more even at highest setting.  At 95 degree outside, the fan did not make any improvement in 12'X12' room temperature than without it.    If the airflow is really bad, then this fan will be helpful.  Keep the fan at highest when the room is not occupied, and turn it down to medium or low when the room is occupied because at high speed it is as noisy as a desktop computer running at 100% CPU load and full airflow.  However, at low speed, my daughter (who is a good sleeper) did not have trouble in taking sleep.    And the thermostatic automatic operation does not work very well. It pulled relatively cool air from main duct even after AC was cycled off and kept pulling the not-so-cold air for one hour until I turned it off.  As a result, it runs continuously until it pulls warm air and fills the room with warm air.    I returned it to the store where I bought.

B00002254J_4209	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	"I like making small boxes during the cold months when being in the shop is an invitation to pneumonia.  Small boxes mean small tools, but a big increment in the requirements for precision.  The tiny little bit off square that would never be noticable in a large table is a cardinal error in a 6"" by 8"" box.  Starrett is the only answer if you want uncompromising accuracy.  The straightedge is absolutely accurate.  It body of the square holds it with no wobble at all.  The bubble level really works,  And everything, right down to the nifty scribing pin is machined perfectly.  It's no lightweight, despite its size, and it will take a lot of banging and dropping without a flinch.  All Starret tools are expensive, whether it's a 4"" square or a 12"" combinatiom square.  Surprisingly, they are not the most expensive I've seen.  But they aren't stamped out in mass quantities, they are individually inspected, and they come in their own little box.  They aren't just the best, they are heirloom grade.  I like the 6"" square better than the 4"", mostly because I'm slightly fumble fingered and there's more to hold.

B0009V1BDA_29513	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I like the idea and use of the grill to take to the park, camping, or tailgating.  Being able to roll allows even the kids to pull it to the picnic spot. Being able to stand up on it's own and not have to sit on a picnic table to use it is a plus.  I have purchased the adaptor hose to connect to a larger propane tank for camping and using for Boy Scout outings.  The Cons:  Cooks very hot & you will have to cook at a much lower temp setting,  Burner design is not the most even heat distribution & have to turn food so it will not burn, Lid design should have been taller to allow better heat and air movement,  Lock is poor design that does not work, just flops back & forth and by design will actually unlock itself when you pick it up to roll, which will cause the lid to bounce open and then drop grill plates on the ground that you have to go back and pick-up,  Last, it has a spring clip that wears out and will not hold grill in the collapsed position, if you stand unit up to vertically on dolly wheels the whole grill will flop to the ground landing on the lid.  To solve most of the issue's I use a bungee to wrap around the whole grill in the collapsed position to keep lid from opening and keep grill attached to leg when rolling.

B0001M4C2O_8608	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	We bought this bow so that the whole family could use a single bow and it does deliver on that promise. It is not a junky toy bow. We specifically went with the Pro for the extra power on the top end, and I am glad we did. At first even the lowest setting seemed too strong for my wife and 7 year old son. But after they played with it a bit and got used to the movement, they did much better. Again, I am happy we went with the the Pro model.  The main drawback (no pun) to all the Genesis bows is the large brace height (distance between the handle and the string). That means that smaller archers cannot get enough pull to generate power, regardless of how strong they are. My son also has a Diamond Nuclear Ice with a much smaller brace height. Even though we set both bows to the same weight, he gets a longer draw and more power from the Nuclear Ice. The arrows fly flatter and sink deeper into the target. BUT, he can't share the Nuclear Ice with anyone else because it's set to exactly his draw length.  So we are very pleased with the Genesis Pro. It's a bow the whole family can grow into and use for years. That makes it a very worthy investment, in my mind.

B0002DH8L4_42962	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Was interested in this litter box specifically since my two cats trace litter all around my apartment and they dig A LOT. My youngest cat seems to really love it; with or without litter. However, my older (and fatter) cat is taking a while to warm up to it. He does fit even if he's a larger boy, but he is a picky to change. I've only had said product about a week, so hopefully he'll get more accustomed to it. The product itself has seemed to reduce litter scatter I would say about 80%. My cat still finds a way to get some litter stuck between his paws, but overall it has reduced the mess a lot! The litter seems to stay trapped in the 'stairs' part and I also already had a litter mat to spare to put at the opening too. Taking the top off and putting it back on may take a few tries, but it's not too bad.  I give this litter box a 5/5 since it does indeed reduce the litter mess and I love the design.

B00026Z4KS_20638	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I have been so happy with this filter!  It is my second Rena Filstar.  The first one I got was the XP4 for my 75 gallon turtle tank.  I loved that one so much that I bought the XP2 for my 49 gallon goldfish tank.  It is super quiet (I find myself periodically checking just to make sure it's still running LOL) and the water has been crystal clear since I installed it.  With my old filter it seemed the water would be cloudy for about 3 or 4 days after a water change and then clear up. But with this filter it's instantly clear and stays that way.  This filter is the easiest to clean out of any other types I've tried. Initial set-up is easy too, except for fitting the tubing on to the valves. That's a little struggle, but the rest is a breeze.

780630866_29357	Reviews_movies_tv	A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 : Dream Warriors takes a turn for the ultimate best after A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 : Freddy's Revenge. Nancy has returned to help the remaining Elm Street kids to defeat the utmost evil, Freddy Krueger. The Elm Street kids are now in a psychiatric ward and are being treated for all types of sleep disorders. And noone will believe them until Nancy shows up. There are 3 very interesting concepts introduced into the NOES series.1. Kristin, played by Patricia Arquette, is one of the newest patients at the ward. She has the ability to pull people into her dreams by calling out their names. They could've overused this technique and made it annoying, but it wasn't overused. Thus it worked wonderfully.2. The term &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; is efficient in the movie. It desribes how each kid had a special power or talent they could only use in their dream. They would later use their special powers or talent to try and defeat Freddy. This also was not overused, and for most of them, their powers or talents worked against them. The director made the best of all of them though, and it was great.3. Each kid also had a weak spot. Such as Taryn, played by Jennifer Rubins, was a recovering heroin addict and Joey, played by Rodney Eastman, was mute. NOES3 is the first Nightmare where Freddy begins to use the kids' weaknesses against them.Each of these concepts were used in the best way possible, and I give mucho kudos to director Chuck Russel for bringing these concepts into the series. Wes Craven also helped in writing the script for this one.The cast has some pretty well-known faces in it also. Patricia Arquette plays the Kristin, she who wields the power of bring people into her dreams. This lady can scream, and she can also act very well. Heather Langenkamp makes her return to the series, and always brightens up the room with her great smile. John Saxon, who is Nancy's father and was in Nightmare 1, also returns. Laurence Fishburne has a very small role, but has a decent amount of screentime.In conclusion, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 : Dream Warriors is one the best entries of the Nightmare series.

783116926_34231	Reviews_movies_tv	***WARNING: A few plot spoilers follow!***First of all, I must say I am reviewing this film as a jaded horror fan which has seen the best and worst of horror that Hollywood has had to offer.  It seems that over the past 20 years that the trend has gone from genuinely frightening to ho-hum to laughable.  Therefore, I love it when certain &quot;new classics&quot; arise to prove that trend is not always correct.&quot;The Changeling&quot; gets the formula right on so many levels.  A haunted house done in the style of &quot;The Haunting&quot; (the Julie Harris version, not the trash that was done on the remake), but with original elements.  George C. Scott (who later went on to star in a great version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;) plays &quot;John Russell&quot;, a musician who tragically loses his wife and daughter in the blink of an eye one fateful day.  He choses to move to a vast, empty mansion in Seattle where he resides alone.  Or so he thinks.  He soon learns that he has an uninvited guest when unexplained clanging and drafts occur on a regular basis.One might argue that if this film was made today, the director may have resorted to CGI for this film, thus ruining some of the ghostly apparitions.  Maybe so, but thankfully, no cheap tricks or special effects gore clog this movie's veins.  What we encounter is a dark, melancholy house which slowly and almost imperceptibly builds an atmosphere of tension and suspense.  This atmosphere leads to a stratospheric climax in the famous &quot;seance scene&quot;, which as one previous reviewer noted, was borrowed in totality by Stephen King for his miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot;.For that matter, while watching this film, I noticed quite a few similarities from &quot;The Others&quot; as well.  I mean, come on, a groundskeeper named &quot;Mr. Tuttle&quot;?  Also, the idea of the &quot;seen&quot; vs the &quot;unseen&quot; history of the house (for example, the piecing together of the history of its inhabitants prior to the 1920s).  &quot;The Others&quot; accomplishes this similarly with the hidden photo albums in the attic, in addition to the deliberately vague information provided by the three strangers who appear to take care of the house.  And &quot;Rose Red&quot; has the main &quot;villianess/heroine/protagonist&quot; (depending on your point of view) actually &quot;living&quot; in a hidden part of the house (whose ever changing geography was a brilliant conception of King and King alone, so far as I know).Anyhow, the thematic similarities between these three films (&quot;The Changeling&quot; of course long preceeded the other two) does nothing the sully the reputation of the two newer films.  On the contrary, I think the writers and production teams were paying homage to this film, and each of those films has many distinctive elements which make them extraordinary on their own.Trish Van Devere puts in a strong performance as Scott's co-star, &quot;Claire Norman&quot;.  It did not surprise me later to learn that she and Scott (were, Scott died in 1999) husband and wife, as their scenes together seemed very warm, natural, and convincing.  Of course, in the end, she gets the wits scared out of her and gives quite a few hearty screams.Melvyn Douglas, an accomplished actor himself, stars as &quot;Senator Joseph Carmichael&quot;.  We learn that he has an intimate connection to the occurrences at Chessman House, though I must say I was completely surprised by exactly how he fits in the puzzle.  And that is something else worth commenting on.  This is in fact a detective story of sorts, a mystery entertwined with a haunted house.  I found this very interesting, and refreshing, much in the style of &quot;The Others&quot;, the magnificent film I alluded to earlier.  There is no &quot;dramatic irony&quot; here because we literally find out what is going on as the character does.I think that some parts are a bit predictable, but it is safe to say that every viewer will be at least slightly taken off guard by the twists and turns this film takes.  And this is a good thing.  The only weaknesses in this film were the insertion of the &quot;conspiracy angle&quot; with Mrs. Huxley and the rather hokey ending with the figure of Senator Carmichael ascending the flaming staircase.  I found myself thinking of the Apostle's Creed, saying, &quot;(Jesus) died, and ascended into hell&quot; (read that carefully).  It is made clear that this is a hallucination of Scott's as another shot shows Douglas sitting at his desk at home, clutching his chest in the throes of a (fatal) heart attack.  Still, I think a much stronger ending would have had Douglas drawing a bath, then found later in his tub, dead, of a heart attack.  No special effects.  No earthquakes.  Just a frozen expression of sheer terror on his face.  And wearing his medal.  After seeing the film, you'll see what I mean by this.Anyway, I shouldn't second guess the writing/direction team on an otherwise flawless effort.  Ideally, I would rate this at four and a half stars, but five does not misrepresent the quality of the film.  Yes, it is definitely a period piece, but what horror movie isn't?  I think that if you have reasonable expectations that don't involve buckets of blood, gore, and a sensory overload of CGI, you'll really enjoy this film.	***WARNING: A few plot spoilers follow!***First of all, I must say I am reviewing this film as a jaded horror fan which has seen the best and worst of horror that Hollywood has had to offer.	133:137	133:137	The Changeling		best		"offer(e, AGENT=Hollywood, THEME=""the best horror"")"	offer(e, AGENT=Hollywood, THEME=horror movies)	#2=THEME	quality	positive	y		
767821408_11312	Reviews_movies_tv	I think that's the line. I've seen this film so many times I can't count. And, no, I can't spurt out great lines. I've never been good at that.So I'll just say that this is one of the top movies of the 90's, and one of the funniest movies ever. I could keep going with hyperboles, but they're meaningless.What makes this film, as one reviewer said, is the humanity. We actually love these guys. Dignan is obtuse, potentially dangerous (mainly to himself), and an adorable little kid. The three of them fight like 12 year olds. I love it when Dignan feels hurt, then mumbles, &quot;You know my mom and Greg (?) aren't speaking to me&quot; (or something like that).The love between Anthony and Inez is sexual and innocent. Surprise. There's no nudity. There's a &quot;come on, let's run away&quot; spirit in Anthony. Inez is more practical. First she has to learn English, since there's no chance Anthony will learn Spanish. Something has to be done. After all, Rocky certainly isn't the best interpreter, and Dignan doesn't give the best messages!The reason I mention Grace is because that little 8(?) year old is the grownup in this film. Dignan even feels threatened by her (I won't give away his defensive retorts). I'm sure this is a major theme in Wes Anderson's films. He is fascinated by adults who haven't grown up (Bill Murray in Rushmore), and kids that are wise beyond their years (Grace, Jason Schwartzman's character and his little friend).See this film, even if you don't like it. It's light, but with layers. Take it on any level you want.	I've never been good at that.So I'll just say that this is one of the top movies of the 90's, and one of the funniest movies ever.	109:117	223:231	Bottle Rocket		funniest		S/superset Bottle Rocket	movies, TIME=ever	#0=movies	funniness	positive	y		one of

783230427_48228	Reviews_movies_tv	&quot;. . . Seeist thou as man sees?&quot;These questions are asked in the Book of Proverbs and in John Carpenter's Village of the Damned, a remake of director Wolf Rilla's 1960 version, both adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos.Village of the Damned is the story of the simultaneous births of telepathic children to every woman of child-bearing age in the coastal village of Midwich, California.  Carpenter's version is more bloody than the version set in Midwich, England, starring George Sanders (but, like many of Carpenter's movies, not as bloody as people think).Carpenter's remake is more hopeful.  Maybe the filmmakers wanted to leave the story open for a sequel, or maybe the survival of one of the children without his extraterrestrial mate is meant to show the possibility of union between the two inimical species.  (&quot;Are we to pity you?&quot; asks Mara, daughter of the town doctor and leader of the alien children, as she explains the facts of cosmic evolution to her father.)The woman quoting Proverbs is the wife of the minister killed by the children before he can shoot their leader.  The minister's wife leads torch-bearing villagers who might have come from a forties Universal horror film.  Though put to the children, the question (Are you human?) is also directed at the other villagers and at us.This Village of the Damned begins with the same deliberate pacing of the original film, a mark of British horror.  Something passes over Midwich and everyone blacks out for six hours.  Not everyone wakes up.If there's a theme it's what duty parents owe their children.  Children often seem like alien monsters even when they weren't conceived in a blackout by an interstellar cloud.  Children demand food and education about the world and ultimately they demand that their parents step aside - -  die - -  for them to inherit it.Here there are good reasons for parents to feel uneasy about their soon-to-be-born offspring - -  some women are virgins or have been separated from their husbands so the children couldn't have been conceived normally.  But none of the parents reject the children for that reason.The mothers have no choice.  After the mass conceptions they all have dreams of  carrying their babies to term - -  the first telepathic action of the childrens' group mind.  The men accept the children, too.  The angriest husband, who's been away for months, at first leaves his wife, but then joins her in the huge delivery room where all the children are born on the same night.After the children are born the adults, even their parents, aren't safe.  The childrens' urge to survive and the knowledge that one species or the other will dominate causes them to play on the emotional bond that exists for the parents, especially the mothers, without being hampered by it themselves.  This isn't much different than the biological adaptation normal infants have acquired to ensure their survival.  David is the exception, the one whose ties to the group mind are weakest.One of the children was stillborn and taken away by a government scientist (or was it?).  She was to be David's partner.  Mara tells David that his lack of a mate does make him less valuable to the group.  As the children realize they have to escape the town and their parents' control - -  grow up - -  the town doctor, Mara's father, has the opportunity (and therefore the responsiblility) to try to save humanity.  David, too, makes a choice.Parents, especially ones with green-eyed children, might have some disturbing thoughts after watching this movie.

078322995X_47902	Reviews_movies_tv	The Prince of Egypt is worthy of a lot of praise indeed.Firstly, the film is so visually stunning, wonderfully grand and spectacular, gorgeously drawn, and originally designed that it's impossible not to be impressed. Character designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet worked absolute wonders with designing the people and animals of the movie.Each individual character exhibits the same amount of love, care, and attention to detail that a human actor would in a live-action movie. Note the sharp contrast of the clean, white, angular lines of Egypt compared to the colourful, organic, natural lines of the Hebrews.Note the awesome pyramids, sphinxes, temples and obelisks accurately recreated in all their original glory. Note the 10 Plagues of Egypt vividly brought to life on screen.Note the grand moment when, as the Israelites cross the Red Sea, two huge whales are seen swimming in silhouette in the water. Note the awe-inspiring desert and mountain landscapes beautifully painted before your eyes.Everything about this movie is a visual triumph!Secondly, Prince of Egypt has a stellar voice cast - probably the greatest ever assembled in an animated film. It's a voice cast that directors dream about:Val Kilmer - turning in a surprisingly emotional and fine role as Moses. Kilmer also provides the voice of God. Instead of the booming voice most of us would expect in such a role, Kilmer's God is as quiet as a whisper, and as gentle as the wind.Ralph Fiennes - who's Rameses is unbelievably intense.Michelle Pfeiffer - Zipporah, Moses's wife.Sandra Bullock - Miriam, Moses's sister.Jeff Goldblum - who's Aaron (Moses's older brother) is surprisingly emotionally acted. A standout role in a film of good roles.Danny Glover - as a flamboyant Jethro, Moses's father-in-law.Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren - wonderfully acting Moses's adoptive parents.And Steve Martin and Martin Short - who play two evil Egyptian priests.On the whole, it's an amazing voice cast who perfectly portray their characters as if they were really acting as them. In particular, I was impressed (after watching Behind the Scenes Footage) how much of himself Ralph Fiennes put into his performance of Rameses.And Val Kilmer? He proves that he's way more than Iceman from Top Gun. His Moses is a role of surprising depth and emotion.And thirdly, Prince of Egypt has an awesome score. I'm not going to even try to describe it, but let it suffice to say that Hans Zimmer (quite possibly the greatest film composer ever) and Stephen Schwartz (Pocahontas, Enchanted) composed it, and that it contains a very beautiful, Oscar-Winning song famously sung by Mariah Carey and the late Whitney Houston - When You Believe.As I said before, I'm not going to even try to describe it, so listen to it here (The Prince Of Egypt: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), or better yet, watch the movie.No really! - watch Prince of Egypt.

783239408_51562	Reviews_movies_tv	To be sure, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will strike some viewers as weird and moribund, but no film before it or since prepares one for its utter familiarity as it hits closer to home than most anyone I know expected.  While not every character here feels identical to anyone I know (and thats a good thing, trust me) more often than not, Spacey and Bening are stand-ins for our friends, neighbors, families and even - ourselves.  The simple theme that &quot;everything is not as it seems on the outside&quot; carries tremendous weight, and I dare the viewer to not see themselves and the people they know behind the curtain that separates truth from fantasy.  Kevin Spacey proves why he is THE actor of our generation, while Menu Suvari, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch cast vivid characters likely roaming our neighborhood high school at this very moment.  The four are uniformly grand.However, this is Annette Bening's shining moment.  Nothing this actress has done before prepared me for a monumental performance that literally shook me to the core.  She is at once in control of all around her and yet desperate to experience her own truest self, free from what she knows, who she lives with, and where she is headed.  Bening captures her character's soul and sends it to the stratosphere, long suffering one moment, and kissing up the next.  Her scenes with the &quot;King of Real Estate&quot; show a desparate range of emotion.  Bening deserved the Oscar, though in a year dominated by Hilary Swank's superlative &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; Bening was a deserved first runner up.A movie that actually makes you think twice about your own existence and how your actions affect the world around you in  unexpected ways.

B00TUZYWXM_404013	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Loved this book,and flew through it. I read other reviews and as stated in my review of the first book I have read all 5 in the series. The biggest complaint I found that was actually had any merit was the story could have been shorter. On that note if you took out what most called the boring or drawn out pages you lose the characters personalities and than it just becomes another sword and sorcery good vanquishes evil story. I loved how Sever took the time and lets you see who the characters are. The protagonists are not adults nor young teens as mature as adults. they stumble through their own issues and act their age. I read a review where the reviewer stated they act to young, Yes they do because they are young. Another stated they had chances to kill some of the adversaries through out, but did not and it is unrealistic. It is actually quite realistic to not kill someone out of spite. The characters are far from perfect and learn through out the book and yes with a little luck and lots of sacrifices to by others to keep them alive they continue to grow. They are the main characters they are not going to get killed off. Books do not work that way or there would be no 2nd, 3rd books, just one where the antagonist wins. I read the book and loved it because it was more than the normal coming of age and vanquish evil story the characters grow, and evolve. Sever does an amazing job of evolving his characters and showing their imperfections throughout this book.

B00H343AA8_236803	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Triage I have to say when I saw this book I was skeptical at best. I figured I would pick it up and have a good laugh then move along. I couldn't have been more wrong if I had picked up Dr. Seuss and thought it was Fifty Shades. Im not a fan of the doctor, but if Dr. Patrick wanted to give me a check up I would enthusiastically jump on his examination table. Wowza!  Patrick is recently divorced and his friends are trying to get him back into the dating world. They take him to a vodka bar where he is encouraged to speak with a beautiful woman he instantly felt was out of his league.  Lisa felt an instant connection with Dr Patrick Anderson and made it known that she was up for a night of unbridled passion. She was desperate to be dominated and felt that Dr Anderson might be just the guy to do that  especially after he made it clear that bad girls get punished. Their night was intense to say the least and neither of them were ready to stop there.  Holy crap on a cracker this book was HOT! Its not everyday you find a book with BDSM done well, especially when its an experienced Dom with either an inexperienced sub or one with past issues.

B019WMKHHC_531730	Reviews_Kindle_Store	The Awakening is one of the great books of the American Canon.  It was surprised for many years because Chopin was a woman who wrote openly about women's sexual feelings when women were not supposed to have such depraved things..  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it still suffers from that in an era when women at one time did not have the vote, there was no such thing as marital rape, and women still, still do not get equal pay for equal work.  All that aside, The Awakening is the American version of Madame Bovary, which in my opinion was the finest novel ever written.

B00FDJ1HRI_210865	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"Rating: 4 stars  Liam Glass is on a errand for the Alpha of his pack, Sampson.  His mission?  To buy gifts for  Evangeline, Sampson's twin sister and equally powerful wolf.  With him are his two young Neapolitan Mastiffs, Lucy and Ethel.  As he is finishing his business at the jewelry shop they frequent, a frazzled man enters with his young daughter.  The stranger is looking for work when his daughter notices the dogs with squeals of joy.  Everything about the man and his daughter speaks to Liam's inner wolf and his need to protect them both.  Travis and his daughter, Hannah, have been left in dire financial straights after paying off the lawyers in his custody case. After winning his case, Travis was forced to sell everything he owned to pay the bills.  All his attempts to find a job have met with failure when he and Hannah walk into a shop on their way back to the hotel. When an attractive customer in the shop offers Travis hundreds of dollars to watch his dogs for the weekend, he accepts the offer without question as it means a roof over their heads and food to eat however temporary the security is for their small family.  When Sampson calls and orders Liam immediately to leave the city on pack business, Liam uses his need for someone to care for his dogs as a means to aid Travis and Hannah without offending the man's pride.  Then he realizes that Hannah can see his true self and everything changes. Liam must protect Hannah and tell Travis the truth.  But will Travis be able to accept the fact that Liam isn't human and cost Hannah the security she needs?  Almost Paradis is a short story full of neat twists on wolf shifters and serves as a great introduction to characters in the new Pine Hollow Wolves series.  Where to start? Liam and his pack are chock full of intriguing characters  in a pack structure that appears to be  a little different from those  I have gotten in other shifter books.  For starters their Alpha, Sampson, has a twin sister who is he equal in power, dominance, and statue. And while the author  doesn't come right out and say it, I believe the Alpha and his sister are both black (a diversity lacking in other shifter  tales).  She is also ""the tallest woman"" Travis has ever seen with an outrageous love of jewelry and sense of humor.  I can't wait to get more of her character and her brother's if she is anything to go by.  I also fell in love with Liam as well.  Who wouldn't love a wolf shifter with two Mastiffs pups he has named Lucy and Ethel and obviously adores? Elegant and comfortable with who he is as a wolf high in status with his pack, he still loves children and falls under Hannah's spell immediately.  I loved their interaction as well.  Travis is heartbreaking as a father who has given up everything he owns to win custody of his daughter only to see themselves made virtually homeless, with no support system and no income to rely on.  He and Hannah are statistics all too common in today's economic reality.  Travis is totally believable right down to the bags of washed and unwashed clothing in the hotel room.  Those who might scoff at a father getting into a car with a stranger who offers food, shelter and money have no idea how desperation effects a persons actions.  In this case, Travis got lucky, he and Hannah bring out the protective instinct in Liam as well as feed Liam's desire to have children.  Then there is Hannah, a totally endearing tot as well as Lucy and Ethel, the Neapolitan Mastiffs with personalities to match their size.  There is no case of instant love here which I appreciate.  It is definitely a case of HFN and Travis asks for certain rights and promises before he agrees to Liam's proposal.  I was so happy to see that this book serves as a expositional setup for the additional books to come. I will eagerly await the arrival of Pine Hollow Wolves #2 and the chance to reacquaint myself with Liam, Travis, Hannah, Evangeline and the rest.  Cover: Artist Lee Tiffin.  I love this cover.  How cute is the father/daughter duo?  This would be perfect except that the animal on the cover is a Husky and not a wolf.  How could the artist make that mistake I don't know but it takes the whole cover down several notches.  They should have done their homework, put a wolf on the cover, and then this would have been one of my Best Cover of the Month.

B015PAA8W4_490992	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Law (Fires of London and Moon Over Tangier are the two Ive read. The 17-year-old, Irish-born future-pinter Francis Bacon is sent off with an uncle to straighten him out. Uncle Lasting has military background and is hearily masculine, but is not himself straight (in either sense of the word).  After good times at the poshest major Berlin hotel, the Adlon, Lasting leaves Francis in something more than a lurch: broke, wanted by the police and the S.A. for a killing Lasting committed. Over the course of the fairly short, but action-packed novel, Francis stays with two young German habitus of the drag bars and small time dealers, with a baron, and with a British Secret Service operative. He is shot at and had killer dogs sicked on him. And has barely thought of trying to paint like the German expressionists whose work he saw in galleries in Berlin before having to be on the run.  I don't know if there can be too much action in a thriller, but Law approaches that line. Like the two predecessor volumes with older Francis Bacons this is not a novel about investigating either whodunit or whydunit of various murders, though murders there are and they are explained quickly before the end. At least I think I know who killed or tries to kill everyone slain over the course of the book, and some reasons for the killings and attempted killings.  Francis is not a camera, though a Leica plays a large part in the intrigue. Uncle Lasting is as unreliable as the vanishing Mr. Noriss. The German boys and the narrator go to Ruegen Island. Laws nature is matter-of-factly gay with some enjoyment of womens undergarments, whereas Isheroods character was discreet about his sexual adventures (the author would later avow that he went to Berlin for the ready availability of German boys, especially lower-class ones) and about late Weimar Berlin entertainment for adults, though not necessarily involving adults.

B00005IBX9_27796	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"A drip coffee maker is not complex, and therefore should not be expensive. A main heating element boils water, which pushes up a tube and out over a hopper of ground coffee, where it slowly passes through and absorbs the oils and organic chemicals we have all come to enjoy. A temperature sensor, visible below the carafe, switches a second heating element beneath the brewed coffee on and off to keep it hot. For consistent brews, the drip through the coffee is controlled by evenly distributing hot water over the ground coffee and the size of the hole at the bottom of the hopper that controls the water passage through the grounds. A spring loaded plunger that rests on the carafe lid blocks the hole when the pot is removed. Knowing how that valve works is essential to proper brewing. On any drip coffeemaker, if you don't ""seat"" the carafe or the hopper properly, the plunger cannot fully open the valve and the brew will be altered. The hopper then overflows with hot liquid and grounds. If you remove the carafe during brew, the water flow through the now closed hopper is altered and deepens the brew.  After review of various drip machines, this clean-lined model provided best features: internal water filter, well designed carafe (comfortable handle, low evaporation lid that stays put during drip-free pours), small footprint, adjustable automatic shut-off and covered reservoir. Nothing is worse than discovering you had been daily passing fresh water over a dead moth that somehow squeezed through the plastic grating over the inaccessible water reservoir.  I accurately measure the water using the carafe and keep the coffee hopper up and unseated while I fill with water to prevent spillage into the dry filter/coffee. The fill port is between basket holder and outer case, toward the back, and any splashes onto the flat solid areas toward the front of the case sends water into the coffee hopper.

B00004OCIX_6039	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	Scoop  11/23/14: update  After using this scoop for over a year, the finish began to bubble up and peel off, revealing an unknown base metal. I threw it out. I really liked this product, so I searched for and found the solid stainless steel version with the same attributes here on Amazon. I ordered it and am very pleased with it. ========== I really didn't expect much from this scoop except a fatter grip, which I need due to a hand injury. A scoop is a scoop, right? Not in this case. The scoop is well balanced, lightweight, and easy to grip. It produces nice, even servings of ice cream instead of clunky chunks even with hard ice cream. This tool makes scooping even the hardest ice cream easier. The pointed but not sharp leading edge of the scoop cuts right into the ice cream, and the grip is nonslip.

B000050APS_23309	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	When I first requested the Vornado Small Room Oscillating Fan (hereafter called Fan) for review, the temps were in the high 80s to low 90s and we had a wonky AC and a call in for maintenance.  By the time it arrived, the AC had been fixed and the temps were in the 40s to 50 and wet and rainy. So, it sat in the box for a week.  Then temps soared again and the Fan came out of the box.  Packaging was nice and the fan was well protected from bumps and such.  Got it out and as it was lifted out and the bag removed, it rattled.  Rattling is not a good sign but nothing seemed loose.  Set it up in my office -- the warmest room in the house -- and turned it on.  It is quiet -- just a very low hum and swish of air at the lowest setting and slightly louder hum on high. It also pivots from straight-ahead to slightly looking down to slightly looking up.  Loved it.  On trying out the oscillation, I found what the rattle was about.  I moved to from left to right and started making a clinking or tinking noise and a not moving.  Turned the oscillation off and the noise stopped and quiet hum resumed. However, I haven't been able to get it back to center.  For me, this isn't an issue so I'm giving it a 4 of 5 stars.  It points at me as I sit at my desk and cools me just right at the lowest setting and when the temps get into the 100+ range in July and August I'm sure the medium and high will get a workout.  Oscillation isn't a feature I use much.  It's also beautiful in a retro-style.  While I love function, form is a nice add on.

B00005KJWV_29116	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"This wok is a great size (BIG), it heats quite quickly, the non-stick coating is still holding up well after several uses, however there are a couple of things I *wish* were different that would make it an unabashed 5 stars for me. First, cleaning it is not overly difficult, but it is a bit more cumbersome when you have to take extra precautions in not getting the electrics wet while cleaning. I was aware that this was not submersible, but it would be great if Aroma made another just like this, but with the option to wash the entire piece in the sink. Still, not a deal breaker. Another issue, which I think is just a small one, is the incredibly thin lid. It is very, very easily dented. Mine already has several dents in it, but because of the thinness of the metal, I was able to push some of the dents out. While this doesn't affect the performance of the lid, it is still annoying to me to see. I leave mine out on a rollable kitchen cart, as this wok is quite large and I don't have a space big enough to tuck it into. This wok is great for not only Asian stir-frying, but also great for frying/cooking many other things, (with the exceptions of foods you need a very flat cooking surface for) or at least that has been my experience. I love that when I cook my bigger meals, I don't have to clutter every burner of the stovetop, as some of my pans are oversized and take up too much space for feasibly putting a pot/pan on the burner directly above or below it. I just plug this wok in on our kitchen island and have lots of space to work. The heat settings dial gives plenty of wiggle room from very low to just-get-it-over-with-and-burn-it. I have not used it on the highest setting, the medium to medium-high settings are what I typically use and works best for my needs. Again, the larger size is just fabulous, and gives me plenty of room to move the food around, and in larger quantities than my stove-top pans do. The feet and base are steady and feel secure enough on the counter, although I do like to move it more toward the middle, but still within my reach, for extra safety.  To sum it up, here's a break-down of my pro's and con's for this wok:  PROS *really large size, ideal for bigger meals* *fast heat time, wide range of heat settings* *saves space on stove top by being a counter top appliance* *non-stick coating has held up well for me, haven't had problems yet with sticking* *the base/feet are level and have not had wobble problems*  CONS *takes a bit extra time to wash and rinse this out, as it is not submersible* *the lid dents very easily, but doesn't not affect performance, just aesthetics* *it's (wonderfully) large size does make it difficult to find a place for me to store it*  While it's not 100% perfect, and the reasons why-(listed under ""CONS"")-are minor issues and do not affect it's cooking performance, for me, it was still a really good purchase and gets it's share of use in our home. I would have given it a 4 and 1/2 star rating were that option available."

B00005EBH0_26149	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	This is a great pitter for your home kitchen.  It works 90% of the time for me.  The other 10% of time I have the pit remains within the cherry as it fails to get punched out.  I still give it a high rating since this is a mechanical solution which depends on several factors such as: the size of the cherry (medium size works best), the speed and amount of pressure you punch the pit (operator skill can improve the success rate).  The one negative comment I have is that the pitter get rust very easily, and it comes without instruction on how to clean it.  I found out that if  you let it sit for drying after a handwash, it will get rust. What you want to do is to take the pitter apart, wash and dry them with a towel immediately after use.  You can take the assembly apart by simply uncrew the black pitter handle.  The spring and the metal rod can now be pulled out for cleaning. Enjoy!

B00002N5Z9_2050	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"SUMMARY: 5/5 stars - glad I bought it, would enthusiastically recommend it to friends, and would not hesitate to buy one again  -----  This Lasko model 2155A window fan - also sold as the Air King model 9155 - is a real blessing for me. I live in the deep South (Georgia) where the oppressive summer heat index (high heat + near-100%-humidity) often reaches into the 130s and above - and I don't have air conditioning. For me, a large whole-house window fan like this one makes all the difference between comfort and living hell when July and August roll around (it's July 27th as I write this, and I'm sitting right next to the window with the fan in it).  This is truly a WHOLE-HOUSE window fan, and it costs so much less to operate than an air conditioner. Compared with central A/C, I'm saving over a hundred dollars a month, which is over $600 a year EVERY YEAR. That's money better spent elsewhere! With this high-volume fan, I get my whole house cooled, without the $150+ monthly electricity usage of central A/C. This fan paid for itself in the first month.  Also, I've found that as I've gotten used to not having A/C, I enjoy the summers more and I'm not nearly as lethargic and short-tempered when I'm in a place without air conditioning, anywhere from the supermarket parking lot to a cookout. It all makes me wonder, WHY would I pay $150+ per month and end up so dependent on air conditioning that I can't be happy enjoying the great outdoors in the summer?! It's all a question of what your body gets acclimated to.  For the hottest summer nights, you can run a little window A/C unit in your bedroom, and still save a bundle because you can use this fan for the rest of the house instead of having to pay the skyrocketing electrical cost of central A/C.  PROS: * Cost-efficient to operate - this fan moves 2470 CFM (cubic feet of air per minute) on only 90 watts - compare that with the larger 20"" model (Air King model #9166) which moves 3560 CFM on 170 watts - an 89% power increase for just a 44% airflow increase...makes sense to just buy two of these 16"" Lasko 2155A/Air King 9155 units instead...you get twice the airflow, not 44% more - and you get it for only ten watts more * Moves a LOT of air - more than a 20"" box fan, more than anything sold at Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, Ace Hardware, True Value, the drugstore, or anywhere else I looked * Fused 3-prong grounded safety plug * Versatile installation options * 3 speeds instead of 2 or just on/off * Electrically reversible for intake and exhaust - a big plus, since I want to be able to exhaust hot air during the day and then reverse it to bring in cool air at night...without having to de-install it and manually flip the whole unit around like you do with some other' brands fans (AHEM!) * Quieter compared to the old metal-bladed fans from years past, which sounded like airplane propellers * Made in the USA by our friends and neighbors and fellow countrymen, not in some Chinese sweatshop  NEUTRALS: * Construction feels a bit flimsy...everything is plastic, except the interior side's safety grille - BUT, this is basically irrelevant, because after it's in the window, it just sits there, and plastic does just as good a job of sitting in a window as metal. And, on the bright side, it's more lightweight than a metal fan would be, making it easier to install and to store in the attic or basement at the end of the season * Don't expect it to be silent on the highest speed, there is some wind noise...but that's not the fault of the fan, and there's nothing anyone can do about it...moving large volumes of air at a high rate of speed DOES entail noise, no matter what, so you can't fault the fan or the manufacturer for that * Pricey - for nearly-all-plastic construction, and only a 50% (maximum) airflow improvement over an $18 Wal-Mart box fan, I felt that the cost of $50-$100 was a bit high...would rather see it around $35-$40 - BUT, in the end, it DOES move more air than the $18 box fan, and has some features that make it worth the cost (electrically reversible intake/exhaust, less noise, expanding side panels to give it a perfect fit with any size window, fused safety plug, Storm Guard feature, etc.) - and given that there's basically no competition in the field any more due to the prevalence of air conditioning, I can't expect pricing to be at super-low highly-competitive rates  CONS: * Switch knob kept popping off...had to tighten up the screws under it and then put a dab of Krazy Glue on it (but that solved it) * Not widely available in stores - because air conditioners' prices have come down so much in the last 15-20 years, the demand for genuine whole-house window fans has gone way down, meaning that this fan is usually a special-order or online-only item, either of which generally entail waiting times and shipping costs (though your local Grainger branch may have one of the ones relabeled Air King in stock)  -----  All in all, I am being really unfairly picky here, and I think this is a fabulous product that I sincerely hope doesn't get discontinued. It's the right unit for the job, it looks good, and it does a better (and quieter) job that the all-metal models from years past. It's also very energy-efficient. Of what's available on the market in 2009, it is the best of the best, hands down, nothing else even comes close. I have ZERO ""buyer's remorse"" about this purchase, and would champion its virtues to anyone considering buying one. A great product!"

B000EVMNMI_39132	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"I told myself I wouldn't do this... I told myself I wouldn't relive the heartache, but... I feel as though I can stop this from spreading like a Japanese chain letter through G-Mail. My name is Garrison and this is my story. It all started a few years back. I was young and discontented with the disheartening candies of today. Sweetarts had lost their tart. M&Ms had turned my ""mmm's"" into ""ehh's."" Kit Kats had brought a cantankerous dissatisfaction that is synonymous to owning an actual cat. My quest of higher blood sugar had proved frugal as I embarked on a pilgrimage to the supermarkets of the 21st century. Every store seemed the same. Carrying the same, uninspired congregation of unpalatable confectioneries that I had shed off throughout my adolescence. These trips were nothing but pure vanity! I returned home, arms empty and sweet tooth untamed. My pursuit of culinary enlightenment had led me to the one place I knew my goal could be achieved; The Internet. I started by googling various candy manufacturers such as ""Mars"" and ""Nestle,"" but grew to less specific searches such as ""popular candy brands."" After watching a Top 10 Countdown from WatchMojo, I stumbled upon a list of popular candy manufacterers. After several moments of scrolling I stumbled upon a seemingly familiar brand name... Haribo. ""Where have I heard that name? It's so familiar!"" I thought. I did a little more of searching until I discovered what seemed so famiilar. ""Of Course! The Gummy Bear!"" cried Garrison. ""I haven't had a gummy bear in ages!"" The thought of a Haribo gummy bear had subtly pleasured my major senses. My mouth began to water in exaltation to the red gummy bear... My God the red one was my favorite... After several moments of reminiscing, my journey came to a close when I stumbled upon the ""Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bag."" 5 Pounds?! I can't even imagine how much that would be, but at the price of $14.95 how could I say no? I placed my order with One-Day Shipping because I needed to become acquainted with these sugary Mammals ASAP. It said my package would arrive by 3:00 PM the next day. Hours pass until my insomnia had turned into a low blood sugar induced Hibernation. I woke up on my bedroom floor, my face reddened from the minute hairs of my carpet I slowly lifted my head toward the ebony clock hanging on my wall. 4:37?? I had slept for 19 hours! I raised myself as I wipe the sweat from my brow and the drool from my lower lip. I stumbled vicariously to the front door, my right arm clenching my GI tract to prevent the hunger pangs from doing it's worst. My fingers hurriedly grip the lock and doorknob as I fling the door wide open. I froze when I see a brown object pressed against my storm door. IT WAS HERE. My limbs couldn't keep up with my mind as I disemboweled this innocent cardboard box like a UPS carnivore. Underneath a thick coating of packing peanuts and bubble wrap was my treasure. I carefully opened the bag, reached through the masses for a red gummy bear and massaged it with my taste buds. Love is in the air! Tears began to flood my eyes as I masticated these simple, sugary creatures. The feelings in my heart were of pure joy. It reminded me of all of the good times I had had in my past. The time when I ate my first Wonderball. The time I had reintroduced a humpback whale that had been washed ashore back into its natural habitat. Or that New Years' Eve when I stumbled upon my high school crush in the crowd of 100,000 and kissed her at midnight. My dream had come true. I was about 30 gummy bears in when my sunshiny land of diabetic bliss, had turned into a dark and stormy realm synonymous to the Further in Insidious. My colon started to make noises that would frighten even the devil himself. ""Something evil this way comes"" thought Garrison as he tightly grips his stomach in pain. The searing pain had gotten worse as I attempt to stand. The gravitational pull of the Earth had weighed down the sugary foodchild that was ready to be born. I spring to the restroom just in time for the contractions to begin. I tore the clothes from my carcass as I place myself atop the hill of Porcelain. At first all was silent. But then, slightly growing in pitch, vibrating against the minute bones of my ears was this noise. MY GOD THE NOISE. A chill had run down my spine as my porcelain chair had turned into an Orchestra of Ungodly Rumblings. Flashbacks of Pompey cross my psyche as I convulsed in agony. I cried out ""DEAR LORD! I REPENT OF MY SINS! PLEASE TAKE THIS PAIN FROM ME!"" Hours pass as the noise slowly dies out. I lift myself off of the commode a changed man. A much lighter man. I must have lost 15-20 pounds. I turn around to see the culprit of my sorrow. MY EYES! I quickly break the lightbulb of my water closet bind my eyes with towels so the abomination can no longer take hold of my senses, and banish this child of Sin to the lowest circles of Hell from whence it had came. I sat blindly in the shower for what seemed like eternity until I was cleansed of my trangressions. I cry tears of relief and show gratitude to my Lord and Savior as I head to my room to sleep off this horrific event. Anyways thank you Haribo for the great purchase! I never thought I would get so much joy out of a food purchase, and I will recommend this to all of my close friends!"

B00X0DDG1O_15819	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	I'm giving this four stars simply because the fabric is wonderful and the item is well made.  I cannot give 5 stars simply because the item runs VERY small.  I am a L/XL at best.  The item I received is a 1X and was NOT flattering on me whatsoever. I am short (5'2), and the legs were about 5 inches too long.  The area that is to bunch at my waist could not, because I was having to pull it up so high to compensate for the extreme length. I am too embarrassed to post pictures as promised.  WITH ALL OF THIS SAID:  The item itself is beautiful and extremely well made!!  It is light and airy and moves with your body.  It would certainly be quite attractive on certain body shapes; just not mine.  I'd like to thank the seller for the opportunity to review this item in exchange for my honest opinion.

Most importantly, when the material stretches, as in on your butt when you bend over, your skin doesn't show. I never wear leggings because of this, and I highly scrutinized these before wearing them in public. But I must say, they pass the test. Also, the busy prints on these totally disguise the 'V' that not all women want to show off. I'm so stoked, I now wear leggings in public. They're great for the gym too, or whatever you're doing. And I've had many compliments on them.  Lastly, I wear a size 12, and the L/XL fits perfect. These are fantastic for the money, and make an awesome gift for you or a friend. Remember, these come from China, so shipping isn't super fast, but it's very reasonable in speed, based on where they're coming from. Your patience will be rewarded! :) Enjoy!

Already it had almost become a throng . Some called for ale , and some for porter , and one for coffee , and all of them for cakes ; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while . A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth , the seed - cakes were gone , and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones , when there came - a loud knock . Not a ring , but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit 's beautiful green door . Somebody was banging with a stick ! Bilbo rushed along the passage , very angry , and altogether bewildered and bewuthered - this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered . He pulled open the door with a jerk , and they all fell in , one on top of the other . More dwarves , four more ! And there was Gandalf behind , leaning on his staff and laughing . He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door ; he had also , by the way , knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before . "" Carefully ! Carefully ! "" he said . "" It is not like you , Bilbo , to keep friends waiting on the mat , and then open the door like a pop-gun ! Let me introduce Bifur , Bofur , Bombur , and especially Thorin ! "" "" At your service !

This last belonged to Thorin , an enormously important dwarf , in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself , who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo 's mat with Bifur , Bofur , and Bombur on top of him . For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy . Thorin indeed was very haughty , and said nothing about service ; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times , that at last he grunted "" pray do n't mention it , "" and stopped frowning .

That sent them on faster than ever , and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast - for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace , I can tell you , when they have to - they took it in turn to carry him on their backs . Still goblins go faster than dwarves , and these goblins knew the way better ( they had made the paths themselves ) , and were madly angry ; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer . Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet , many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner . The blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following ; and they were getting deadly tired . "" Why , O why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole !

All that morning they were busy with preparations . Soon after midday they ate with Beorn for the last time , and after the meal they mounted the steeds he was lending them , and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his gate at a good pace . As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned north and then bore to the north-west . By his advice they were no longer making for the main forest-road to the south of his land . Had they followed the pass , their path would have led them down the stream from the mountains that joined the great river miles south of the Carrock . At that point there was a deep ford which they might have passed , if they had still had their ponies , and beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road . But Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the goblins , while the forest- road itself , he had heard , was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost . Its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain , and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when they got to the other side . North of the Carrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River , and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer , Beorn advised them to take this way ; for at a place a few days ' ride due north of the Carrock was the gate of a little -known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain . "" The goblins , "" Beorn had said , "" will not dare to cross the Great River for a hundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my house - it is well protected at night ! - but I should ride fast ; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off , and Wargs run swifter than ponies .

But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes . "" Insect eyes "" he thought , "" not animal eyes , only they are much too big . "" Although it was not yet very cold , they tried lighting watch - fires at night , but they soon gave that up . It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all round them , though the creatures , whatever they were , were careful never to let their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames . Worse still it brought thousands of dark- grey and black moths , some nearly as big as your hand , flapping and whirring round their ears . They could not stand that , nor the huge bats , black as a top-hat , either ; so they gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness . All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages ; and he was always hungry , for they were extremely careful with their provisions . Even so , as days followed days , and still the forest seemed just the same , they began to get anxious . The food would not last for ever : it was in fact already beginning to get low . They tried shooting at the squirrels , and they wasted many arrows before they managed to bring one down on the path . But when they roasted it , it proved horrible to taste , and they shot no more squirrels . They were thirsty too , for they had none too much water , and in all the time they had seen neither spring nor stream .

If these had not become all too light in the last few days , they would never have managed it ; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs filled with food however heavy . In a few days a time came when there was practically nothing left to eat or to drink . Nothing wholesome could they see growing in the woods , only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell . About four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most of the trees were beeches . They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change , for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep . There was a greenish light about them , and in places they could see some distance to either side of the path . Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall . There was a breath of air and a noise of wind , but it had a sad sound . A few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on . Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest . Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary . At times they heard disquieting laughter . Sometimes there was singing in the distance too . The laughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goblins , and the singing was beautiful , but it sounded eerie and strange , and they were not comforted , rather they hurried on from those parts with what strength they had left . Two days later they found their path going downwards and before long they were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks . "" Is there no end to this accursed forest ? "" said Thorin . "" Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round . The only way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path . "" Of course "" somebody "" meant Bilbo . They chose him because to be of any use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves , and so he must be light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him . Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees , but they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path , and up he had to go as best he could . He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye ; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs ; more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time ; and at last , after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to be no convenient branches at all , he got near the top ."

Of course there were only thirteen of them , twelve dwarves and the hobbit . Where indeed was Thorin ? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him , magic or dark monsters ; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest . There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams , as evening wore to black night ; and there we must leave them for the present , too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching . Thorin had been caught much faster than they had . You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep , as he stepped into a circle of light ? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward , and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted . All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night , their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them , and all the sounds of the battle next day , had passed over him unheard . Then the Wood-elves had come to him , and bound him , and carried him away . The feasting people were Wood-elves , of course . These are not wicked folk . If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers . Though their magic was strong , even in those days they were wary . They differed from the High Elves of the West , and were more dangerous and less wise . For most of them ( together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains ) were descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West . There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages , and grew fairer and wiser and more learned , and invented their magic and their cunning craft , in the making of beautiful and marvellous things , before some came back into the Wide World . In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon but loved best the stars ; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost . They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods , from which they could escape at times to hunt , or to ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight ; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk .

Hobbit_3045_31	literature	"In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves , whom they accused of stealing their treasure . It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different account , and said that they only took what was their due , for the elf-king had bargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver , and had afterwards refused to give them their pay . If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure , especially for silver and white gems ; and though his hoard was rich , he was ever eager for more , since he had not yet as great a treasure as other elf-lords of old . His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels , nor did they bother much with trade or with tilling the earth . All this was well known to every dwarf , though Thorin 's family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of . Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of him , when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses ; and also he was determined that no word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him . The king looked sternly on Thorin , when he was brought before him , and asked him many questions . But Thorin would only say that he was starving . "" Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their merrymaking ? "" asked the king . "" We did not attack them , "" answered Thorin ; "" we came to beg , because we were starving . "" "" Where are your friends now , and what are they doing ? "" "" I do n't know , but I expect starving in the forest . "" "" What were you doing in the forest ? "" "" Looking for food and drink , because we were starving . "" "" But what brought you into the forest at all ? "" asked the king angrily . At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word . "" Very well ! "" said the king . "" Take him away and keep him safe , until he feels inclined to tell the truth , even if he waits a hundred years . ' "" Then the elves put thongs on him , and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong wooden doors , and left him . They gave him food and drink , plenty of both , if not very fine ; for Wood-elves were not goblins , and were reasonably well - behaved even to their worst enemies , when they captured them .

Next day the dwarves all went wandering off in various directions ; some were exercising the ponies down below , some were roving about the mountain-side . All day Bilbo sat gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone , or out west through the narrow opening . He had a queer feeling that he was waiting for something . "" Perhaps the wizard will suddenly come back today , "" he thought . If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest . As the sun turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof , as if the light caught the last pale leaves . Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes . He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth . At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him .

Hobbit_3714_29	literature	Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he began to sweat . A sound , too , began to throb in his ears , a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire , mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring . This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him . It was at this point that Bilbo stopped . Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did . The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing compared to it . He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone , before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait . At any rate after a short halt go on he did ; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel , an opening of much the same size and shape as the door above . Through it peeps the hobbit 's little head . Before him lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the Mountain 's root . It is almost dark so that its vastaess can only be dimly guessed , but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow . The glow of Smaug ! There he lay , a vast red-golden dragon , fast asleep ; thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils , and wisps of smoke , but his fires were low in slumber . Beneath him , under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail , and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors , lay countless piles of precious things , gold wrought and unwrought , gems and jewels , and silver red-stained in the ruddy light . Smaug lay , with wings folded like an immeasurable bat , turned partly on one side , so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed . Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail , helms and axes , swords and spears hanging ; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled with a wealth that could not be guessed . To say that Bilbo 's breath was taken away is no description at all . There are no words left to express his staggerment , since Men changed the language that they learnt of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful . Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before , but the splendour , the lust , the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him . His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves ; and he gazed motionless , almost forgetting the frightful guardian , at the gold beyond price and count . He gazed for what seemed an age , before drawn almost against his will , he stole from the shadow of the doorway , across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure . Above him the sleeping dragon lay , a dire menace even in his sleep . He grasped a great two -handled cup , as heavy as he could carry , and cast one fearful eye upwards .

Hobbit_4172_3	literature	" Certainly not the dragon , or he would not go on squeaking .  They waited a moment or two , and still there were no dragon-noises , no sound at all in fact but Bilbo 's distant voice . "" Come , one of you , get another light or two ! "" Thorin ordered . "" It seems we have got to go and help our burglar . "" "" It is about our turn to help , "" said Balin , "" and I am quite willing to go . Anyway I expect it is safe for the moment . "" Gloin lit several more torches , and then they all crept out , one by one , and went along the wall as hurriedly as they could . It was not long before they met Bilbo himself coming back towards them . His wits had quickly returned soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights . "" Only a bat and a dropped torch , nothing worse ! "" he said in answer to their questions . Though they were much relieved , they were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for nothing ; but what they would have said , if he had told them at that moment about the Arkenstone , I do n't know . The mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts ; and when the heart of a dwarf , even the most respectable , is wakened by gold and by jewels , he grows suddenly bold , and he may become fierce . The dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging . All were now eager to explore the hall while they had the chance , and willing to believe that , for the present , Smaug was away from home . Each now gripped a lighted torch ; and as they gazed , first on one side and then on another , they forgot fear and even caution . They spoke aloud , and cried out to one another , as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and fingering them . Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood , and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them ; and being magical ( and also untouched by the dragon , who had small interests in music ) they were still in tune . The dark hall was filled with a melody that had long been silent . But most of the dwarves were more practical ; they gathered gems and stuffed their pockets , and let what they could not carry far back through their fingers with a sigh . Thorin was not least among these ; but always he searched from side to side for something which he could not find . It was the Arkenstone but he spoke of it yet to no one . Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls , and armed themselves ."

Hobbit_4974_3	literature	"Upon one side were the Goblins and the wild Wolves , and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves . This is how it fell out . Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury . Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities , colonies and strongholds ; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North . Tidings they had gathered in secret ways ; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming . Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley , going ever by tunnel or under dark , until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North , where was their capital , a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon the South . Then they learnt of the death of Smaug , and joy was in their hearts : and they hastened night after night through the mountains , and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain . Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind . How much Gandalf knew cannot be said , but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault . This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard ; and with Dain , for the dwarf - lord now joined them : the Goblins were the foes of all , and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten . Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain ; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east . Yet this would be perilous , if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself , and so attack them also from behind and above ; but there was no time for make any other plan , or to summon any help . Soon the thunder passed , rolling away to the South - East ; but the bat-cloud came , flying lower , over the shoulder of the Mountain , and whirled above them shutting out the light and filling them with dread . "" To the Mountain ! "" called Bard . "" To the Mountain ! Let us take our places while there is yet time ! "" On the Southern spur , in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet , the Elves were set ; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves . But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North . Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain 's feet black with a hurrying multitude . Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur 's end and came rushing into Dale . These were the swiftest wolf-riders , and already their cries and howls rent the air afar . A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance , and many there fell before the rest drew back and fled to either side . As Gandalf had hoped , the goblin army had gathered behind the resisted vanguard , and poured now in rage into the valley , driving wildly up between the arms of the Mountain , seeking for the foe ."

Animal_Farm_16_11	literature	At one end of the big barn , on a sort of raised platform , Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw , under a lantern which hung from a beam . He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout , but he was still a majestic -looking pig , with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut . Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions . First came the three dogs , Bluebell , Jessie , and Pincher , and then the pigs , who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform . The hens perched themselves on the window-sills , the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters , the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud . The two cart-horses , Boxer and Clover , came in together , walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw . Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life , who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal . Boxer was an enormous beast , nearly eighteen hands high , and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together . A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance , and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence , but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work . After the horses came Muriel , the white goat , and Benjamin , the donkey . Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm , and the worst tempered . He seldom talked , and when he did , it was usually to make some cynical remark - for instance , he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off , but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies .

They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism , especially from Clover , for whom they had an almost filial respect ; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it . The farm was more prosperous now , and better organised : it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington . The windmill had been successfully completed at last , and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own , and various new buildings had been added to it . Whymper had bought himself a dogcart . The windmill , however , had not after all been used for generating electrical power . It was used for milling corn , and brought in a handsome money profit . The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill ; when that one was finished , so it was said , the dynamos would be installed . But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream , the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water , and the three - day week , were no longer talked about . Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism . The truest happiness , he said , lay in working hard and living frugally . Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer - except , of course , for the pigs and the dogs .

The formation of this storm makes this year a tie with the {{W|1933 Atlantic hurricane season]] for the busiest hurricane season ever, with a total of 21 storms.  Wilma is currently about 220 miles (370 km) southeast of Grand Cayman and 230 miles northeast of the Nicaragua / Honduras border. It is currently moving slowly southeast at 5 mph (8km/h). The storm has winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The system is expected to move over warm waters with little wind shear which could lead to a rapid intestification of the storm into a hurricane within 72 hours. Scot McKenzie Has been called to use his super human powers to squelch the tempest and bring peace to the World  The storm track raises concerns over Gulf of Mexico crude oil rigs already devastated by two prior hurricanes, Katrina and {{W|Hurricane Rita|Rita]].

r401_5_16	TNE_dev	Irish inflation creeps upwards to 2.4%  June 11, 2005   The inflation rate in Ireland, as measured by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), edged upwards to hit a five month high in May at 2.4%. This represents a 0.2% rise on the previous month when the rate stood at 2.2%.  The major contributors to the rise were increased transportation, healthcare, and education costs. In April the EU25 average rate of inflation was 2.1%, with Latvia having the highest rate at 7.1% and Sweden the lowest at 0.4%.  Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003.
