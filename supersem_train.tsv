05-068_Photometry_(astronomy)_21	wikipedia	One typically speaks of performing differential, relative or absolute photometry.  Differential photometry is the measurement of changes in the brightness of an object over time; these measurements are compiled into a light curve of the object.  Relative photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightnesses of multiple objects relative to each other.  Absolute photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightness of an object on a standard photometric system, these measurements can be compared with other absolute photometric measurements obtained with different telescopes/instruments.  In most cases differential photometry can be done with the highest precision, while absolute photometry is the most difficult to do with high precision.

We can similarly approximate the gravity field of the Earth by a spherically symmetric field:  of which the equipotential surfaces -- the surfaces of constant potential value -- are concentric spheres.  It is more accurate to approximate the geopotential by a field that has the Earth reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces, however.

05-071_Plant_life-form_5	wikipedia	"Plant life-form schemes constitute a way of classifying plants alternatively to the ordinary species-genus-family scientific classification.  In colloquial speech, plants may be classified as trees, shrubs, herbs (forbs and graminoids), etc. The scientific use of life-form schemes emphasizes plant function in the ecosystem and that the same function or ""adaptedness"" to the environment may be achieved in a number of ways, i.e.  plant species that are closely related phylogenetically may have widely different life-form, for example  and  are from the same family, but the former is a small herbaceous plant and the latter is a shrub or tree.  Conversely, unrelated species may share a life-form through convergent evolution.  The most widely applied life-form scheme is the Raunkiær system."

05-072_Psychology_29	wikipedia	"They doubted the validity of introspection for studying internal mental states such as feelings, sensations, beliefs, desires, and other unobservables.  In ""Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It"" (1913), Watson argued that psychology ""is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science,"" that ""introspection forms no essential part of its methods"", and that ""the behaviorist recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.""  Skinner rejected hypothesis testing as a productive method of research, considering it to be too conducive to speculative theories that would promote useless research and stifle good research.  Behaviorism reigned as the dominant model in psychology throughout the first half of the 20th century, largely due to the creation of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behavior, and their successful application in the workplace and in fields such as advertising and military science.  Work most associated with psychologist Albert Bandura, who initiated and studied social learning theory, showed that children could learn by social observation, without any change in overt behavior, and so must be accounted for by internal representations."

05-072_Psychology_42	wikipedia	Cognitive psychology is radically different from previous psychological perspectives in two key ways.  It accepts the use of the scientific method, and generally rejects introspection as a valid method of investigation, unlike symbol-driven approaches such as Freudian psychodynamics. *  It explicitly acknowledges the existence of internal mental states (such as belief, desire and motivation) unlike behaviorism.  Links between brain and nervous system function were also becoming understood, partly due to the experimental work of people such as Charles Sherrington and Donald Hebb, and partly due to studies of people with brain injury (see cognitive neuropsychology).  With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology.

05-072_Psychology_157	wikipedia	Whereas clinical psychology focuses on mental health and neurological illness, health psychology is concerned with the psychology of a much wider range of health-related behavior including healthy eating, the doctor-patient relationship, a patient's understanding of health information, and beliefs about illness.  Health psychologists may be involved in public health campaigns, examining the impact of illness or health policy on quality of life and in research into the psychological impact of health and social care.  Human factors psychology (sometimes called Engineering Psychology) is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools and objects in the environment.  The goal of research in human factors psychology is to better design objects by taking into account the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior.

Even though the diversity may be low, numbers are high, and the taiga (boreal) forest is the largest forest biome on the planet, with most of the forests located in Russia and Canada.  Agricultural potential is generally poor, due to the natural infertility of soils and the prevalence of swamps and lakes left by departing ice sheets, and short growing seasons prohibit all but the hardiest of crops.

05-089_Subarctic_climate_24	wikipedia	In some areas, ice has scoured rock surfaces bare, entirely stripping off the overburden.  Elsewhere rock basins have been formed and stream courses dammed, creating countless lakes.  There is very little precipitation, no more than 15 inches (38 cm) over an entire year and, away from the coasts, occurs mostly in the warmer months.  Low precipitation, by the standards of more temperate regions with longer and warmer winters, is typically sufficient in view of the very low evapotranspiration to allow a water-sogged terrain in many areas of subarctic climate.  Should one go poleward or even toward a polar sea, one finds that the warmest month has an average temperature of less than 10°C (50°F), and the subarctic climate grades into a tundra climate even less suitable for trees.

On the other hand, the appearance of the new moon earlier than was expected was regarded as unfavourable, as it was believed that anything appearing prematurely suggested an unfavourable occurrence.  In this way a mass of traditional interpretation of all kinds of observed phenomena was gathered, and once gathered became a guide to the priests for all times.

Brazil, which like most other countries cultivates coffee as a commercial commodity, relied heavily on slave labor from Africa for the viability of the plantations until the abolition of slavery in 1888.  The success of coffee in 17th-century Europe was paralleled with the spread of the habit of tobacco smoking all over the continent during the course of the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 48).

The problem was that Stalin's strategy risked confrontation with the equally powerful United States, who viewed Stalin's actions as a flagrant violation of the Yalta agreement.

Virgil spoke of a distant Golden Age and recurrent cycles of history.  The Bible outlines a narrative of history from Creation to the End of time.  One Biblical periodization scheme commonly used in the Middle Ages was Saint Paul 's theological division of history in to three ages: the first before the age of Moses (under nature); the second under Mosaic law (under law); the third in the age of Christ (under grace).

By 1914 the London tram companies formed the largest tram network in Europe, but the onset of the Great War saw a halt in the expansion of the trams, and thousands of staff left to join the armed forces to be replaced by ""substitute"" women conductors and drivers.

Hence, for a given #FORMULA#, the goal is to find #FORMULA# so that #FORMULA# is minimized.  This is done by solving the sample version (stochastic counterpart) of the KL divergence minimization problem, as in step 3 above.  It turns out that parameters that minimize the stochastic counterpart for this choice of target distribution and parametric family are the sample mean and sample variance corresponding to the elite samples, which are those samples that have objective function value #FORMULA#.

Although many labs have a slightly different approach, the main concept is to find from a myriad of protein conformations which conformation is of the lowest energy or, in the case of Folding@Home, to find relatively low energies of proteins that could cause the protein to misfold and aggregate other proteins to itself -- like in the case of sickle cell anemia.  The general scheme in these projects is that a small number of computations are parsed to, or sent to be calculated on, a computer, generally a home computer, and then that computer analyzes the likelihood that a specific protein will take on a certain shape or conformation based on the amount of energy that is required for that protein to stay in that shape, this way of processing data is what is generally referred to as distributed computing.  This analysis is done on an extraordinarily large number of different conformations, owing to the support of hundreds of thousands of home-based computers, in hopes to find the conformation of lowest possible energy or set of conformations of lowest possible energy.  Although being able to prove that a certain conformation is of the lowest possible energy is rather difficult, it is possible, by observing the energy distribution of a large number of conformations, despite the almost infinite number of different protein conformations possible for any given protein (see Levinthal Paradox), with a reasonably large number of protein energy samplings, to predict relatively closely what the expected lowest energy should be.

05-053_Medicine_19	wikipedia	Possibly the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine.  This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general - see Copernicus 's rejection of Ptolemy 's theories on astronomy).  Physicians like Ibn al-Nafis and Vesalius led the way in improving upon or indeed rejecting the theories of great authorities from the past (such as Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna), many of whose theories were in time discredited.  Such new attitudes were made possible in Europe by the weakening of the Roman Catholic church's power in society, especially in the Republic of Venice.

Because of the predominant solid phase in these systems they are notoriously difficult to study microscopically without simultaneously disrupting the fine spatial distribution of their components.  These are defined by gradients of water temperature, nutrients, dissolved gases, salt concentrations etc. Along the path of terrestrial water flow the resulting temperature gradient continuum alone may provide many different minute microecosystems, starting with thermophilic bacteria such as Archaea ""Archaebacteria"" (100+°C), followed by conventional thermophiles (60-100°C), cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) such as the motile filaments of Oscillatoria (30-60°C), protozoa such as Amoeba, rotifers, then green algae (0-30°C) etc. Of course other factors than temperature also play important roles.

Many options exist to conserve or enhance specific ecosystem services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs or that provide positive synergies with other ecosystem services.  The bottom line of the MA findings is that human actions are depleting Earth’s natural capital, putting such strain on the environment that the ability of the planet’s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted.  At the same time, the assessment shows that with appropriate actions it is possible to reverse the degradation of many ecosystem services over the next 50 years, but the changes in policy and practice required are substantial and not currently underway.

It is a football variant played on a rectangular grass or artificial turf field, with a goal at each of the short ends.  The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring the ball into the opposing goal.  In general play, the goalkeepers are the only players allowed to use their hands or arms to propel the ball; the rest of the team usually use their feet to kick the ball into position, occasionally using their torso or head to intercept a ball in midair.

The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools.  They were not universally adopted.  During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football.  Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867.

The bowls are usually made of turned wood, although small lidded baskets of woven straw are a cheaper alternative from China.  The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take a stone from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, and then place it directly on the desired intersection.  Although it can be soothing and pleasant run one's hand through the bowl or hold a handful of stones, this can be noisy and unnerving to one's opponent; it is considered good form to take only one stone at a time as one decides where best to play.

On the other hand, in the handheld market, Yokoi's refusal to adopt a color display for the Game Boy in favor of long battery life is cited as the main reason it prevailed against Sega's Game Gear and the Atari Lynx.

However, the concept of nested objects was familiar in Russia, having been applied to carved wooden apples and Easter eggs ; the first Fabergé egg, in 1885, had a nesting of egg, yolk, hen, and crown.  The story goes that Sergei Maliutin, a painter from a folk crafts workshop in the Abramtsevo estate of a famous Russian industrialist and patron of arts Savva Mamontov, saw a set of Japanese wooden dolls representing Shichi-fuku-jin, the Seven Gods of Fortune.  The largest doll was that of Fukurokuju - a happy, bald god with an unusually tall chin - and within it nested the six remaining deities.

Poses can range in length from several seconds to many hours.

It pre-dates the use of graphite as a drawing medium and was used by old masters such as Jan Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer and Raphael.  The technique is commonly associated with the Renaissance but enjoyed a revival in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  Renaissance artists used silver and occasionally leadpoint for underdrawings of their paintings and for separate studies on paper.

Alphonse Legros, Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Joseph Stella helped revitalize the medium at various times.

02-015_Borders_of_the_continents_20	wikipedia	The modern world is in consensus that Europe ends at the Aegean Sea, the Black Sea and the Ural Mountains, but the boundaries between these latter two features are uncertain; that leading from the Urals to the Black Sea, for example, has been drawn by different authorities as at the Don, the Kuma-Manych Depression, the Caucasus, the Russian frontier or the Rioni River.  Western sources (e.g.  the National Geographic Society) usually state that the Europe-Asia boundary follows the watershed of the Ural Mountains from near Kara, Russia on the Kara Sea to the source of the Ural River, then follows that river to the Caspian Sea.  The border then follows the watershed of the Caucasus Mountains from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.  By this definition, the Ural Mountains are on the border of Europe and Asia, likewise for the Greater Caucasus (although Mount Elbrus, which would be the highest point in Europe, is north of the watershed divide, and as such would be entirely in Europe by this definition).

In the Age of Exploration from the 15th century to the 17th century, cartographers both copied earlier maps (some of which had been passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' observations and new surveying techniques.  The invention of the magnetic compass, telescope and sextant enabled increasing accuracy.  Due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer.  For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the Beaver Map, published in 1715 by Herman Moll.

Commons are a subset of public goods ; specifically meaning a public good which is not infinite.  Commons can therefore be land, rivers and, arguably, money.

02-059_Map_31	wikipedia	Many but not all maps are drawn to a scale, allowing the reader to infer the actual sizes of, and distances between, depicted objects.  A larger scale shows more detail, thus requiring a larger map to show the same area.  For example, maps designed for the hiker are often scaled at the ratio 1:24,000, meaning that 1 of any unit of measurement on the map corresponds to 24,000 of that same unit in reality; while maps designed for the motorist are often scaled at 1:250,000.  Maps which use some quality other than physical area to determine relative size are called cartograms.  A famous example of a map without scale is the London Underground map, which best fulfils its purpose by being less physically accurate and more visually communicative to the hurried glance of the commuter.

02-064_Mine_exploration_17	wikipedia	Abandoned mines may have larger features such as timber bridges, inclines, waterwheels, or merely tunnels and vast chambers.  Mine explorers may on occasion boat across underground lakes, particularly if this enable a trip through a mine working that comes out of a different adit to that used for entry: such trips can be challenging and regarded as an achievement by the participant in a way not dissimilar to a mountaineers conquering a hill.  Photography of mine workings is often a significant component of the desire to explore abandoned mine workings and there are many websites dedicated to hosting such photographs (see below).

02-076_Pit_cave_5	wikipedia	"A pit cave (or vertical cave), often simply called a ""pit"", is a type of natural cave passage which is vertical rather than horizontal.  Entry into pit caves requires specialized caving techniques, akin to technical climbing, for example the single rope technique (SRT) which involves the use of 11-12 mm nylon static rope and mechanical descenders/ascenders.  Vertical caving, also called ""pit caving"", is a very specialized sport that should be undertaken only if one has gained knowledge of proper vertical caving equipment and its proper use.  Due to the fact that one must hang over a pit by a single rope, vertical caving is more dangerous than horizontal caving.

All the names of and on the islands are fully discussed by Coates (1990).  The islands are comprised of Tertiary igneous formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements.  The archipelago represents the remnants of a long-extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40 metres (130 ft) below sea level.

The island of Dùn ('fort'), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch.  MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a galleon fleeing the defeat of the Spanish Armada, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), provide the more credible (if less romantic) explanation that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.

02-096_Total_dissolved_solids_7	wikipedia	Total dissolved solids are normally only discussed for freshwater systems, since salinity comprises some of the ions constituting the definition of TDS.  The principal application of TDS is in the study of water quality for streams, rivers and lakes, although TDS is generally considered not as a primary pollutant (e.g.  it is not deemed to be associated with health effects), but it is rather used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of drinking water and as an aggregate indicator of presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants.  Primary sources for TDS in receiving waters are agricultural runoff, leaching of soil contamination and point source water pollution discharge from industrial or sewage treatment plants.  The most common chemical constituents are calcium, phosphates, nitrates, sodium, potassium and chloride, which are found in nutrient runoff, general stormwater runoff and runoff from snowy climates where road de-icing salts are applied.

Ions from the dissolved solids in water create the ability for that water to conduct an electrical current, which can be measured using a conventional conductivity meter.  When correlated with laboratory TDS measurements, electrical conductivity provides an approximate value for the TDS concentration, usually to within ten percent accuracy.  Hydrologic transport models are used to mathematically analyze movement of TDS within river systems.

In The Politics of Park Design: A History of Urban Parks in America, (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1982), Professor Galen Cranz identifies four phases of park design in the U.S. In the late 19th century, large tracts of land on the outskirts of cities were purchased by city governments to create ""pleasure grounds"": semi-open, charmingly landscaped areas whose primary purpose was to allow city residents, especially the workers, to relax in nature.  As time passed and the urban area grew around the parks, land in these parks was used for other purposes, such as zoos, golf courses and museums.  These parks continue to draw visitors from around the region and are considered regional parks because they require a higher level of management than smaller local parks.

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act made the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository.  The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.

EPA established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001.  The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site.  The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard.  The individual-protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public.

He bends his knees 90° and then alternately raises his legs to bring his right elbow and left knee together and then left elbow and right knee together, resulting in a leg motion that resembles pedaling a bicycle.  In the past it has been considered risky due to the stresses it places on the body, particularly by causing compression of the cervical disks in the neck, but when performed slowly and without pulling too hard on the head it is safe to do.

03-006_Bisulfite_sequencing_56	wikipedia	By first using in vitro transcription of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A can be used to cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites.  As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine -specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired.  The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF.  Bisulfite treatment either results in introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions, or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A (purine -to- pyrimidine) conversions in the amplified reverse strand.

03-023_Disability_64	wikipedia	The Expert/Professional Model has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the Medical Model.  Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the Medical Model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person.  This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.  The Tragedy/Charity Model depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance, deserving of pity.  This and Medical Model are probably the ones most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.

Visual acuity is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.  Resolution in CPD can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of white–black stripe cycles.  For example, if each pattern is 1.75 cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye, it will subtend an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white–black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern.  The highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes, or distinguish from a gray block, is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye.

Compulsory admission to mental health facilities (also known as Involuntary commitment or sectioning), is a controversial topic.  From some points of view it can impinge on personal liberty and the right to choose, and carry the risk of abuse for political, social and other reasons; from other points of view, it can potentially prevent harm to self and others, and assist some people in attaining their right to healthcare when unable to decide in their own interests.  All human-rights orientated mental health laws require proof of the presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards, but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions.

Fraternal siblings result from the fertilization and implantation of more than one egg, so fraternal siblings are not genetically identical, and instead have the coequal genetic similarity any other full siblings do.  In some multiple births, it is possible for a combination of these (for example, a set of triplets may have one fraternal baby from one egg, plus two identical twins from a second egg).  This is called a polyzygotic birth.  The most common form of human multiple birth is twins (two babies), but the typical order of multiple births in other placental species differs dramatically.

Two gene conversion mutations predominate; one is a splice site mutation affecting the 5' spice site of intron two, while the second is an exon two nonsense mutation.  The SBDS gene is expressed in all tissues and encodes a protein of 250 amino acid residues.  The function of this protein is not known and it has no primary sequence similarity to any other protein or structural domain that would indicate a possible function.

B000IXC8W2_188031	Reviews_Video_Games	"This game is great in the sense that it's extremely involved and has an interesting storyline. The only problem is that the dialogue begins to drive you crazy after a while. Characters will talk back and forth at an average of about one to five minutes and at certain times can go on for about 15 to 20 minutes. And really nothing they say adds any profound meaning the story. Added to this, most of the dialogue is corny. So, what ends up happening is you're playing for about 10 minutes, and then they talk for 5. It doesn't seem like much, but you'd swear after a while that conversations pop up every time you turn a corner.  I'm trying to be conservative in my numbers here to not exaggerate how long the dialogue can take, but at about half way through the game, you'll come to a point where, (I kid you not) they run you through a 20 minute, drawn out, mind boggling, painfully pointless, wordy dialogue. Halfway though the twenty minutes you're already livid about the endless jabbering, but it's the last ten minutes where you'll feel the slip of your sanity being removed from the last part of your brain.  Now this game just doesn't have a normal ending. It has your ""WTF!!!"" Mist type ending. All of your adventures will end in one big anticlimactic ""WTF just happened"" added with the ""Maybe there's something more after the credits are over"", but sadly no there isn't. You're left with mouse in hand and a confused look on your face and coated eyes of despair of how much of your life you have just wasted.

B0009OGJ02_143964	Reviews_Video_Games	"Sonic The Hedgehog CD(1993). Sonic's third adventure, and the only Sonic game released on the Sega CD system.  By 1993, Sonic 2 had already been out for a year, and the series had become one of the biggest things in gaming around that time. But before Sonic 2 had even come out, Sega had begun the workings of what would eventually become Sonic CD (hence the reason for the similar graphics like Sonic's animations and the shield and lamposts from Sonic 1). It was also around 1993 that Sega had begun to promote their Sega CD add on, so they also thought it would be a good idea to jump the gun and throw their mascot on that system as well. Thus, Sonic CD came into existence.  Now unlike some Sega CD games which were just Genesis ports with added CD-quality music and the ""CD"" thrown on the end of the title, Sonic CD is actually its own game, and boy does it sure do a lot to stand out from the others. This adventure sports 2 awesome soundtracks (one for Japan, and another one for everywhere else), TONS of levels, some new tricks, and most evidently the main feature of the game: the ability to time travel. That's right. You can literally CHANGE TIME PERIODS WITHIN EACH ACT FROM THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE! How cool is that? Sadly, to this day, no other Sonic game (and even most games out there) has ever tried to mimmick this awesome feature. Now some Sonic fanatics out there will tell you that Sonic CD isn't an official Sonic game, and they'll put it down relentlessly in favor of the Genesis titles. While I agree that the Genesis Sonic games are all classics, don't listen to these fools who diss on this masterpiece. It's a very underrated game in the context of the rest of the series sadly due to its only platform being the Sega CD, which few were willing to shell out cash for a whole system just to play one game (let's face it, aside from Sonic CD, the Lunars, Terminator, Snatcher and a handfull of others, the rest of the games on the Sega CD were nothing but FMV crap). But there are many who have, and most will tell you it is indeed a great game and fits right alongside greats in the series like Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic Advance 3. Now let's look at all the neat stuff this game has to offer:  PROS -COOL SOUNDTRACK! Yes, it's dated and veeery early 90s sounding, but a lot of the level tunes fit their environments really well, and some songs even flat out rock! The ""Sonic Boom"" theme song will be stuck in your head for days. There's a bit of hip-hop thrown in there with some corny tacked on ""do-wap"" style vocals, but overall the soundtrack works. Sonic 2 still holds the top spot for best music though. -FAST PACED, INTRICATE LEVELS TO EXPLORE. Unlike the loosely fixed paths of Sonic 1's stages and the polished warp speed environments of other games, Sonic CD's stages are very layered and have huge areas to explore at any place in the stage. Plus, they also have a slight ""roughness"" to them and don't seem solely based on perfect speed through formulas that the other Sonic game's stages were designed for. -SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE BOSSES IN ANY SONIC GAME. Just look at some of them: A pinball machine level-boss, a boss surrounded in breathable bubbles to break through, and a race with Sonic's metallic twin, Metal Sonic. 'Nuff said. -I've mentioned the time warping already, but I must address the feature that lets you CHANGE THE FUTURE OUTCOME OF EACH STAGE. That's right, each level has both a good and bad future, in addition to the past and present. The past has a very organic, pastel look to it, where as the present is more bright. The good future also appears bright, though with machinery and wildlife existing in harmony, whereas the bad future is depressing and depicted much like a graveyard of the present or good future of a particular zone. To get the good future, you must travel to the past and destroy a robot generator thing. This actually gives the player a reason to explore the levels besides simply cruising through them. -AWESOME SUPER PEEL OUT MOVE! Why this wasn't put into any other Sonic game is beyond me, but this move is basically a super speed dash without the spin, and Sonic's feet look like a figure 8. Really cool. -VERY AWESOME STORY AS WELL. Technically, since it takes place between Sonic's 1 & 2, Tails is nowhere to be found, but in his place is the introduction of Amy Rose (who you'll see a lot more of in the Sonic Adventure games and the GBA titles). Metal Sonic is much better than the Robo-Sonic thing from Sonic 2 as well.  CONS -THERE ARE 3 ACTS PER ZONE, BUT THE THIRD IS JUST A PIT STOP. You'll only fight a boss in this act, so there might as well just be two acts. -And speaking of bosses, while they are very innovative in creation, some can be brought down in just a couple of hits! Why waste them like this? -The super speed dash move is flawed in this game. You have to let it fully charge before you can take off, which might put off some newcomers. -Some of the zones are merely repeats of ones found in Sonic 1. There's enough variation, but you can still see the similarities.  There you have it. The underdog of the Sonic series. If you're a new fan, don't start with this one, but do find it any way you can. Until Sonic Gems collection came out recently, Sonic CD was VEERRRY hard to find on console. It's also available on PC as well, so go play it!"	Sonic 2 still holds the top spot for best music though.	37:41	2637:2641	Sonic CD		best		music, ENVIRONMENT=Sonic CD	music, ENVIRONMENT=Sonic games	music	quality	positive	y		
B00006F2ZP_79637	Reviews_Video_Games	Spyro Enter the Dragonfly is the worst out of all its previous releases,including gameboy advance games (Spyro Season of Ice and Fire). It takes 'forever' to load, it is difficult to control spyro, there is a lack of new characters and being able to play as different characters, like in spyro 3. There's only one boss in th entire game, the game is too short - it has only 9 levels and 1 world, unlike the previous series - over 25 and 4 worlds. Overall, I thought that the game was easy, boring and very predictable. Universal has ruined this game and its rival Crash Bandicoot (Wrath of Cortex). This game really suits PS1 rather than PS2, yeah.. The graphics may be well developed, but the playability is what counts. Now here is a note of warning: if you are wanting to buy this game, do not trust websites that have previews saying that it has over 25 levels.

B0009Z3HXI_150357	Reviews_Video_Games	I bought this game with my christmas money and went home to play it only to realize the best NYC graphics and the most real New Yorkers! First of all, you really can't just ignore the crime alerts for too long because eventually, the businesses in that area will shut down, causing you to waste time finding another store just the same that IS open. If you cruise through the areas that have the highest crime rate, you will notice the buildings have boards over the windows and there is ALOT of graffiti hanging around this area and if you frisk people that are in this area, they will most likely be holding drugs or a box of stolen jewelry!!! Bt, if you ride through the areas you have cleaned up, the buildings will be fresh looking and there will be less thugs in the area, and less crime alerts. But, all in all, the graphics are simply amazing! It is just so real in the life of a street cop, good or bad.  Hop my review helped!!!

B000B43OY4_154502	Reviews_Video_Games	I bought my Xbox 360 in Feb 2006.  I have had it know for 9 months.  So far my system has had no problems.  I will admit two of my friends systems have had the red rings of deaths but they were also early adopters.  Hi-Def  The system itself is nice I have it hooked up in non hi def and it still looks really great.  I have seen it in my friend's house in hi-def and it looks absolutely stunning.  So you do not need high def it is a bonus if you have it.  System  I have played on every system since the Atari 2600.  The Xbox 360 wireless integrated controller is the best to date just edging out the legendary PS2 dual shock.  Able to turn on the Xbox from the controller and the ability to jump to Xbox live by the main button priceless.  This is the first system my wife has ever played with me.  The good part about the system is its easy to develop for well the PS3 won't be (Sony systems are notorious difficult to develop for).  So most next gen games will be built for the 360 and ported over to the PS3, of course you could argue they will make it better for the PS3 when they port it over.  It has a huge 6 million console lead and is expected to be the most sold console for the next few years.  What does that mean everyone will be making games for this system the base is to big to ignore.  Online  I will admit this is the first system I have ever gone online with.  I don't even play online games on my computer.  I have heard the hype about Xbox 360 live its better that that.  I don't know how they did it but it's so integrated with the console.  I have about 40 online friends it's so easy to jump on games with them, talk to them.  My wife got her own gamer tag she likes going online so much.  I still like playing offline the beauty of online it triples the replay value of the games.  Games  Okay first off you will hear how they don't have a lot of exclusives.  Well in the next gen war no system will.  Second that statement can be deceiving Ghost Recon Advance War (GRAW) is not an Xbox 360 exclusive except the X box 360 version got ratings of 9.5 and is the greatest game I have ever played the PS2 version got ratings of 5.5 and is a mess so its not exclusive but its not the same game on the other system.  Gears of War A true exclusive game is one of the best games I ever played. The rub is if your kid is under 13 he best not be playing it, it is mature only.  The kids games do seem to be lacking but they are starting to come out finally.  Wrap up  If I had young kids I would not recommend this for them, online is great but people online can swear.  The best games that make this system are Teen and Mature games.  For the over 13 crowd this is the system to get.  Cheaper than the PS3, graphics are rumored to be on par.  The library of games is already impressive with a few games that are downright incredible.  The best part its on the shelves waiting for you unlike the other systems which will be impossible to get this Christmas.  Just for the record we will get a PS3 for my son in the future because he is 8 and loves his PS2.  Also the WII looks awesome so if you don't have a huge PS2 library or your kids are hooked on Sony I would take a look.  I want all the systems to win because competition is good for everyone.  I would also like to see the prices come back down $600.00 for the PS3 is too high if it didn't come out at that price point I think the 360 would have been in more trouble.  Final Wrap Up  An impressive second system from a company I personally am not a fan of but don't let that stop you they have done a great job with this console.

B0009UBR3A_145649	Reviews_Video_Games	"This game is Merely incredible.  Words cannot describe my love for this game.  I played and beat this game once before because I borrowed it from a friend.  And I have not played this game in a few years.  So I decided to buy it.  Seriously one of the best purchases I've made.  I am a huge Legend of Zelda fan... and have played many Zelda games.  Although this in my opinion is the best game next to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.  I have not played Skyward Sword yet... Anyways this game is great for anyone. Zelda fan or not a Zelda fan.  This game has everything a game should possibly have.  So I will rate this game based off of every category I can think of.  1. Gameplay:  The gameplay is incredible.  Controls are kept pretty simple. I wish there were more buttons on the gamecube controller though because you can only have 2 items selected at once. It was very enjoyable to play.  2. Overall Difficulty: 7-8/10.  10 being rating stupid hard. It was made with a good amount of difficulty. Not too hard and not too easy. Some parts could have been a little more challenging.  3. Puzzle Difficulty: What I realized this time... It really depends on the age of the person playing this game.  I played it in my younger years and thought the puzzles were very difficult. I played it again now and realized that there is a trick to all the puzzles in the game.  You just need to find out where it is.... So I'd give the puzzles a 7/10.  10 being too difficult.  And each puzzle did take some time.  On the major puzzles I spent like anywhere from 5-20 minutes trying to figure it out. Not bad at all.  4. Bosses: Woww. The bosses were super fun.  Part of me wishes they were more difficult because they were pretty easy once you figure out what your suppost to do.  And other times I enjoyed it the way it is.  So the bosses are pretty easy.  But wayy fun. There was a couple of bosses though that I felt like ""okay this is too easy.""  So I wish it was more of a challenge but you still find your self enjoying them.  5. Dungeons:  The Dungeons were pretty fun. They can get confusing at times. But you just really need to search. Think and be clever. Not too hard and not too easy. Very well made. One dungeon or level area... ""The Cave of Ordeals"" wasn't too bad. Near the end it's kinda of pain in the butt. Mostly because of ice monsters.  I found myself only getting really annoyed at a couple dungeons.  The Ice Palace being one of them.. haha. But overall the Dungeons were very enjoyable.  6. Map: The Map is very Big. I wish there were more side quests in this game with such a big map. Overall very fun.  The Twilight realm and light realm both look pretty cool. And have the right feel to them.  7. Adventure Feel: Ohh man... Yeah... Once I started it was hard to put it down.  It had such a great feel to it.  The way the adventure sucks you into the game.  If your a fan of any adventure or RPG style games.  This is definitely a game you should play.  8. Collectibles: I'll put it this way.... either take a Crazy LONGG time on the game... or use a guide.  My goal is to get a 100% one day without a guide, but we'll see if I can do that.  I'll do that when I'm old and retired. haha. It would take a ton of dedication.  Anyways it's fun getting new equipment and trying it out.  And using it to your advantage. Overall, the equipment is pretty user friendly.  9. Plot: Woww. Incredible plot. I really enjoyed the whole aspect of Light and Dark, Good vs Evil. Very well portrayed in the Zelda game. Had a some very rememberable quotes.  10. Emotion: Mann.... In my opinion as for emotion this is the most emotional Zelda game out there. It's mainly because the love you develop for the characters and the sense of being the hero.  There were moments in the game where you feel like crying. Not trying to sound un-manly or wimpy or nerdy. Just the emotion put into this game is incredible. The joys and sorrows that you feel while playing this game. Remarkable.  11. Music: Haha... Actually I'm listening to the music right now. I've listened to it for the past few days. I LOVE Zelda music. The simple dungeon or walking around music isn't too rememberable... but the Theme music for towns, shops, Character theme music, and boss theme music is incredible.  Helped make this game even more enjoyable.  All music fits very well with the mood and theme of each location.  12. Effects: The effects look really cool.  Especially with the equipment. The sound effects are AHhh!!! AHhmazing. Like the clinging of the ball and chain.  Or the Whoosing of the boomerang.  13. Characters and Character Development: Woww.  The Characters are incredible.  Like I said before.... you develop a love for the characters and you'll fight evil and do whatever you can to help and save them.  Very Epic and heartfelt.  The Companion in this game ""Midna"" is probably my most favorite companion in any zelda game. Maybe tied for first with Navi and Tatl.  Not sure. Anyways you develop a very close bond towards Midna. What an incredible character.  14. Graphics: Very good for the release time. Looks good and sharp. I've always really enjoyed the Dark And Light sharp look for Zelda games. It makes it seem more like an Adult game rather then a more Kid game.  I mean I love all Zelda games and all the graphics but this one has my favorite graphic style.  Very Good. More of a Dark look theme Vibrant colorful look.  I prefer the Dark look because it makes the mood of the game more serious.  15. Enemies: Not too hard not too difficult. Overall I enjoyed fighting most of the enemies.  They were pretty fun to fight... except for a few annoying enemies. haha basically any Ice enemy, Poe, or too many of certain enemies got annoying.  But overall I rarely found myself getting too frustrated or finding it too easy.  16. Overall Enjoyment:  This is on my list of BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME.  Overall, I give it a 9.5-10. Probably a 10.  I really enjoyed the whole game.  My love for this game cannot be described in words.  I tried to and ended up writing one of the longest reviews.  So if you havn't played this game. Go out and buy it either for Wii or Gamecube. I bet you'll find yourself loving this game as much as I do. This is just amazing... It's remarkably Beautiful.  MASTERPIECE."

B00015MFYI_112035	Reviews_Video_Games	I liked the gameplay videos I saw on the web. It really looked like the game system would give me a ninja like experience when playing. After I tried it, I confirmed my predictions except by a inevitable fact that this title's difficulty was extremely hard. I bought it a few years ago and still haven't been able to complete it. What I hate most is that there isn't save states in the middle of levels so if you can't beat the boss, you are forced to start all over again next time you turn on the ps2. That is discouraging enough to keep it in its box for several months hoping the desire to complete it comes back again. Unfortunately, I am stubborn enough to keep trying... but not until one or two months have passed again.

B0001DLLWC_114039	Reviews_Video_Games	"City of Heroes has been the best execution of a MMORPG launch that I've ever seen.  Many that I've played in the past have been plagued with bugs and connection problems.  For all game developers of MMORPG's, the launch is critical in how fast and well word spreads about the game either making or breaking a game in its first 2 months of release. The object of the game after creating a hero is to ""arrest"" villans throught the city to accumulate experience to advance in level as well as influence points that can be spent on upgrades to skills and abilities.  The city is broken up in to multiple suburbs catering to each level of hero then each suburb is further broken down to zones that are color coded to reference the highest and lowest difficulty villians wandering each sect. Characters can be created a choice of ""origin"" assigns the hero to a sort of guild that affects the types of missions the hero can choose from and which stores they purchase equipment from after the inital levels.  You then choose an archetype, which is a class of character being Tank (fighter), Blaster (ranged offensive fighter) etc.  After choosing skill sets comes the fun part, creating the gender, look and costume.  Capes are currently not available, but the patch that is supposed to arrive soon (June 04) will allow for more variety of costumes as well as additional areas to explore. An expansion pack has already been announced for 2005 called ""City of Villans"" that will allow a PvP aspect (which currently doesnt exist). The great part about this game is that once you get in to the teen levels, you almost have to go after villans in groups balanced with a good variety of characters (healing, fighting, defense) to succeed.  The creaters of CoH have done an excellent job of creating an atmosphere where people can easily group together (unlike many other MMORPG's where its hard to find other people to group with), all you have to do is click the ""seek team"" button to put yourself on a list to be invited by another group or even check the list and create your own. I've tried to be as brief as possible in describing this game, there is much more to check out if it sounds interesting so far (more info on the game is available from their web site coh dot com)."

B00002SVO9_18394	Reviews_Video_Games	This is one of those rare examples of a game that has nothing wrong with it. I will list off the three key points, and how this game not only nails them, but beats them into the ground with an industrial strength jackhammer  Graphics: This was the first 16 Meg game on the Genesis. For those not in the know, this means that the game stored 16 megabits, or 16 MEGA POWER!!!!!!!!!!! Because of this enhanced storage, they were able to create more detailed graphics, more sprites, and smoother animations. The the smoothness of the character animations, and the bright, vibrant, and highly detailed backgrounds are simply gorgeous to gawk at, even today.  Sound: What can be said; This is, without a doubt, the greatest video game soundtrack of all time. Composer Yuzo Koshiro used his deep knowledge of the then outdated PC-8801 hardware to create an extremely memorable and very engaging soundtrack that makes you want to keep moving left and kicking ass every second. All the tracks sounds unique in their own right, and are a blast to listen to.  Gameplay: This is one of the best examples of a Side-scrolling Beat' em up. Most games wimp out by just having a punch/kick combo. The combat in this game is very deep, with each character having a variety of different, powerful moves. Add this with amazing and extremely fun two-player action, four players to choose from that all play differently, and you have a game that will stick with you for a while.  This is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone, and if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.

B000F5IH2I_166648	Reviews_Video_Games	"I have been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for years and this is the first serial installment of the series (which I exclude FF XI) that I have sort of mixed feelings on. There is good and there is bad and I won't go into the gameplay as it has been done here so many times that I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said so I'm just going to jump straight to the what's good and what's bad to me as I feel that is where my true contribution to ""reviewing"" this game lies. Ok, bad news first ...  The Bad  1.) I didn't like the character progression with the license system. It was just sort of uninteresting, it wasn't bad and it suffers from how cool the sphere grid was, but most of the time it just felt more annoying than anything and most of the time I just forgot all about it anyway. In the end your true progress seemed determined by your equipment and not your license board anyway.  2.) Character progression. Early in the game your team just seems ridiculously weak and battles are difficult to the point of frustration and later in the game battles seem too easy (main quest.) It seemed the amount of challenging and balanced play was so fleeting even I hardly remember when that moment was. I also feel the battle ""challenges"" focused too much on status effects. Often times in heated battles especially early your entire group gets hits is mass confusion, blindness, and poison and your party eventually kills itself for lack of any capability to defend itself.  3.) Dead air throughout the game. The maps are actually too huge for my liking. There are LOTS of moments in the game where you have to reinvestigate areas for sidequests and what not and while there are mild short-cuts you spend a lot of time to walking. This was probably one of my biggest pet peeves of the gameplay itself. Teleport crystals and airship access didn't really make this any easier and some sidequests required almost an hour of just walking through areas that you've already been through and sometimes again and again. Load times were not the best either as it worked to load in huge maps. This dead time wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many relavent sidequests as well  4.) Espers were difficult to acquire and were useless to use in battle. Granted in FF8, I think they focused too much on Guardian Forces, but in FF12 they are usually only useful in the fact that getting them gets you closer to getting pieces of equipment that are more useful than the Espers themselves. Most of the time you want to beat Chaos to get to the vendor in the corner of his lair and not the Esper himself. It just sort of felt backwards  5.) Random chests and certain events. I strongly dislike the random chest mechanics of this game especially when things are geared away from positive acquiring of items. I disliked it in Crystal Chronicles and the same frustration is carried over here. This forces you to reset the game a lot or constantly revisit areas in an effort to have a slight chance at the chests containing an item that isn't utter crap. In that same respect often you will have to revisit different locations during random area effects like when it is raining or cloudy requiring more revisiting and going in and out of areas and again enduring the load times  6.) The music. It is well below the quality of the other FF games  7.) Characters playwise are all similar in the latter part of the game. Eventually you just play with whoever you think looks the coolest  8.) Here at last is my number one problem Final Fantasy 12, the weak storyline, pacing, and narration. All of the characters could have been cool, but the storyline seems forgotten 90% of the time you are playing the game. The Final Fantasy series has its reputation strongly from the novel like quality storyline you receive and FF12 just neglects it to focus more on maps and gameplay. In the end characters die and somehow you can tell we were supposed to care, but we don't. Heck you hardly even knew who they were, so why should you care. You don't hardly know what the characters motivations or ambitions even are really or what drives them to fight so hard and risk their lives for the endeavors throughout the game. In short you don't really care about any of them either way, not even the villain. I can't say that you hate him, or anything he's just this obstacle to climb over and than he's forgotten. In the end you don't laugh, cry, or hardly care in any way. I've never left a Final Fantasy feeling that way. I saw potential for characters that was just never capitalized on  The Good  1.) The graphics. The graphics look great. The watercolor like pastel tones are a great escape from the graphics that we are used to in the series.  2.) The gameplay is innovative. I really didn't like it at first and than I realized much of that had to do with frustration over the early level of difficulty. After I got used to the playstyle I found myself liking it and I really see this as a positive evolution in the series. In the end I found myself liking ADB, but I can see how many will not. I think given time many will find the new mechanics very similar to what they are used to in the ""traditional"" series. Some will not like having to do the initial ""programming"" of the games AI with the gambit system, but once it is set you really don't have to do it again often. Many who reprogram the gambit system often for larger battles I can see getting frustrated, but me I found something that roughly stuck and stayed with it.  3.) Whilst I did complain about ""too many sidequests"" above most of it has to do with the constant running around and travel. The fact that the sidequests are expansive make continuing to play Final Fantasy enjoyable. If you get ""everything"" before finishing the game expect the last guy to be a walk in the park, but if you reserve some of the harder exploration till later and at a leisurely pace you can get well over 120+ hours worth of play out of this game. That can really help you get your money out of this game  In the end, I see this as the first step towards the direction FF is going. To me it was a bit of an ackward step, but I still am optimistic and I think looking at it more and more we are headed to good times with this piece. The storyline was disappointing and I often wonder what those mentioning a ""great story"" in their reviews were coming from or if they played any of the other FF titles before this one. I think if they continue to develop the battle system and work in a more solid storyline than we'll be very impressed with FFXIII, until than these are growing pains and even as a weaker FF (in my opinion) this is still a great game and deserves a good rating as it is still well above most games we see released now. I think it is well worth playing through and I think most will be satisfied"	This was probably one of my biggest pet peeves of the gameplay itself.	28:35	1780:1787	Final Fantasy XII		biggest		There are LOTS of moments in the game where you have to reinvestigate areas for sidequests and what not and while there are mild short-cuts you spend a lot of time to walking	my pet peeves OF=the gameplay OF=Final Fantasy XII	pet peeves	size	positive	y		
B00000JRSB_4833	Reviews_Video_Games	This game is most likely the best game I have ever played as far as Playstation games go.  It would be the best game ever, but Zelda still tends to take that category for me.  Regardless, though, this game is an absolute classic and a must-play for everybody who's an RPG fan.  If you're not an RPG fan, try it and see if you like it because it just might change your opinion of them.  This game is very in-depth, with three CD's packed full of surprises, secrets, action, and a very drawn out plot that will suck you in instantly.  The characters are very original and work well with each other's personalities.  The music is by far the best I've heard from the Final Fantasy series and I go back to listen to it again and again on my soundtracks.  Controls are easy to use, and the battle system is typical Final Fantasy set-up, but the graphics make it very realistic.  The camera angles and be a bit annoying at times when trying to select a player, but the box at the bottom of the screen with all the statuses tend to clear that up and make it less of a big deal.  The magic, money, and experience system is very easy to learn and use and very self-explanatory once you get into it.  The game is simple enough for beginners to learn (seeing as it was my first real RPG that I picked up, and I learned quick), but hard enough to keep hardcore players satisfied (there are two American-version only monsters that are ultra-hard and I still haven't gotten around to beating them because it takes so much preparation!)  Most of the cut-scenes are realistic and the only thing that would've made them better would've been voice-overs.  The plot will have you laughing, crying, and everything in-between as you relate to the characters.  Negatives?  I really don't think there is any.  There's a lot of foul language from a couple of the characters, so this isn't for somebody who's easily offended by that.  Other than that, the dialogue will pull you into the plot.  Be warned, this game will suck up a lot of your time once you get going.  All in all---a definite must have for anybody who loves Final Fantasy!	It would be the best game ever, but Zelda still tends to take that category for me.	17:21	107:111	Final Fantasy VII		best		MAKE(e, PRODUCT=Final Fantasy VII)	MAKE(e, PRODUCT=games, TIME=ever)	#1=PRODUCT	quality	positive	y

Does keep my system extremely cool but again is the quietest. It also does not connect via USB but through an AC adapter so it doesn't steal power from your 360.  It also doesn't obstruct the intercooler so they can work together.  *EDIT* Per another users request here is additional information. I hope this helps more.  I tried it without the intercooler and I also tried one of my other fans without the intercooler for you and from what I can tell the 360 casing is noticeable cooler with this stand. The casing normally gets extremely warm along with the air that is being sent out. With this stand (with the intercooler its better) alone the air itself from what I can tell is much cooler. I keep my 360 in an open area by my TV and since its winter the heater blows on the 360 so I find these cooling devices essential.

B0000296O5_11941	Reviews_Video_Games	TL;DR: FF8 is worth a try. If the gameplay and story appeal to the player, the player will have an enriching, immersive experience. The player will need a guide to get the most out of the game.  This review is about twenty years late. Better late than never.  Final Fantasy 8 (FF8) is a great game that will appeal to certain players within the role-playing community. The gameplay and story set it apart from most role-playing games that existed at the time of release (1999). It is not for casual players or those new to the role-playing genre, but is suited for gamers with an intermediate level of experience. The gameplay is different than most games, and will be unfamiliar to inexperienced gamers; and the story can be difficult to follow.  Music / Sound  FF8 has a solid soundtrack, and is mostly driven by the style of a synth-based orchestra. The music is appropriate to each setting  battles, the mobile university, a seaside town  all have a theme that speaks well to the setting. I can remember specific songs in specific areas of the game, after not playing for years. However, I would not listen to the soundtrack by itself, as many of the tracks are not catchy or memorable enough to warrant an independent listen. The production quality is some of the best available for Playstation One (PS1).  Visuals  FF8 pushes the console to its limits visually, and portrays each character as real people with real-world problems. The realistic approach works well within the storyline, and aims to have the player relate to the characters, particularly Squall's inner life. However, PS1 has its limits, and many of the graphics become pixelated and distorted throughout the game. The Guardian Force attacks, however, stand out as some of the most elaborate in-game graphics at the time of FF8s release. The game also has full-motion CGI  some of the best on PS1. The cut scenes look great, add depth to the story, complement the in-game graphics, and resemble an actual film.  Story  This is my favorite part of the game. The story is a great adventure, complete with romance, rivalry, personal transformation, and an epic quest; and engages the player right away. The player is introduced to Squall's inner thoughts, and has choices occasionally on how to respond, using dialogue. The concept of seeing the Squalls actual dialogue along with his private thoughts was innovative, and will be particularly relatable to players who spend a lot of time thinking. The romantic component of the story was engaging, particularly the relationships between Rinoa and Squall, Julia and Laguna, and Raine and Laguna. This aspect of the game will appeal to hopeless romantics, but may turn off action-oriented gamers. Squall also has a rival in Seifer to serve as a foil (a character with an opposite personality that highlights another characters traits). Both the romance and rivalry serve the plot well, and do not distract from the overarching plotline. Both serve to help Squall in his personal transformation from loner to leader, one that is fascinating and inspiring to watch. The focus on his inner thoughts really help to make his personal growth visible. Much of the story develops the characters and their relationships with one another throughout the game, and adds a lot of depth to the main plot.  The epic quest can be difficult to follow, but the aforementioned pieces keep the player engaged. The plot can become clunky at times due to the overly-complicated story combined with long hours of grinding required. It is easy to forget what is happening or become confused, especially if the player does not play for a few weeks. The plot takes time to sink in  I really did not get it until my third play-through of the game - but it was worth it. There are some great moments in the game that give the player a sense of who the characters truly are - Seifer leading the player-controlled team on a mission, Quistis' monologue with Squall on the balcony of Garden, Squall's pursuit in space - that are emotionally moving. The ending is one of my personal favorites, and is a great conclusion to the game.  Gameplay  I have mixed feelings about the gameplay. It has some great innovations that are executed well, some tedious battling, and some missed opportunities that make it frustratingly difficult. I really like the junction system of drawing magic from enemies that, in turn, can be used to enhance a players stats, depending on how the magic is junctioned to a specific stat. This element adds a great deal of strategy to building stats, and makes grinding to get better magic more fun. For example, Fire can be junctioned to the strength stat to increase attack power; or the player can attach Blind to the strength stat to increase the chances of inflicting Blind on an enemy, using a normal attack. The player can also draw Guardian Forces from enemies, and can use them in battle against future enemies. The Guardian Forces level up and offer specific abilities for the character to which they are attached.  If the player likes to grind to build levels, there is no shortage of opportunities in FF8. There are many, many random encounters throughout the game, and can only be reduced after getting a specific Guardian Force. Fighting random battles is required to get magic, earn a consistent income, and maintain rank. The money system operates like a real job  the player gets paid based on rank, and the rank will drop if the player does not fight enough random battles. The system is innovative, as executing certain missions well and fighting a lot of enemies will increase rank, but becomes tedious when rank needs to be maintained by fighting battles, as it forces the player to grind even if they do not need to level up. Improving rank through missions decreases in opportunity as the game progresses, and I was disappointed that there were not more opportunities to improve rank by rescuing someone, defeating a boss, completing a quest in a certain time limit, or simply following orders. One strength to the rank system is that it plays very well into the story of a student graduating from a military academy. It engages the player and encourages a desire to help the main character succeed by completing missions. The combination of earning rank, being able to see private thoughts, and making decisions in regards to dialogue all help the player feel as though they are a critical part of the game.  The only other distraction in the gameplay is - and this seems to be true in every Final Fantasy title - the player needs a guide in order to get the best items and complete all side quests. Many of the best weapons and special attacks in the game are only attainable by having certain items, or in the case of some characters, finding magazines, some of which are extremely difficult to locate. Some items are nearly impossible to receive as a dropped item. The game does not offer a lot of guidance when it comes to these items; therefore, the player who wants to get the most out of the game will need a guide. I find this to be a nuisance, as I would have liked to have been able to complete the game using only in-game clues. It is not fun to have to rely on guides to tell the player exactly what to do when the game offers too little direction. The player will be able to complete the game without a guide, but after a certain point in the game, some of the best equipment, Guardian Forces, and items become unavailable. If this happens, it is disappointing, because the player realizes they cannot go back to get those special items.  On a side note, the in-game card game is a lot of fun. It is basically like trading cards that can be played and collected, and can be used to get great items later in the game. I had a friend that played simply for the card game.  Comparison  FF8 is much different than past FF titles, in just about every regard. Much of the story is centered on romance, and the junction system and card game are new. The junction system is a refreshing take in comparison to the standard go-to-new-town, buy-new-equipment, find-special-equipment-in-a-dungeon, then-repeat, formula found in many role-playing games. The weapon upgrade system reminded me of Parasite Eve. The best way to describe the game is different. For me, these differences made the game a lot of fun, and very unique.  Overall Presentation  FF8 is worth a rental (or test on an emulator) to see if the gameplay and story is right for the player. I really enjoyed the romance of the story, the character development, and the junction system. The only real drawbacks are a tedious grinding system, and an overly-complicated plotline. As I said before, if the player is willing to invest the time, the story is worth figuring out. I had a lot of fun playing through the game, especially on the second and third playthroughs, once I really understood the junction system and the story. There are a lot of different strategies that can be used on subsequent playthroughs, so the gameplay never became boring. It was also fun to realize something new about the story each time.

B000G820UE_179242	Reviews_Video_Games	Did you ever wonder what it would have been like to sail Titanic into New York harbor? That would be serious business and so is this software. The program features various vessels, along with Titanic all then way down to a 35 footer, participating in missions in four different locations with you in command. The ships respond realistically to engine and rudder commands. I found it to be the closest thing to actually being on the bridge out at sea. Young gamers may not have the patience required to handle these missions in real time, reading charts, minding weather conditions and being ever watchful for other ships in the shipping lanes. The supplied documentation leaves a lot to be desired and is particularly silent on editing missions or creating your own which would be fun if they only bothered to explain how. And the scenarios for the power racing boat are unrealistic to the point of being rediculous, with jumps, requiring speed to accomplish, placed too close to spectator boats. But there are plenty of other pre-programmed missions for the other ships to keep you busy for quite a while. Despite a few shortcomings I do recommend this especially for boating enthusiasts who are house-bound during the winter months on land. Try it, full speed ahead.

B000AVBFU8_153500	Reviews_Video_Games	"Tales of Legendia is a lot like the recent Tales of Symphonia. All of the ""Tales"" games have been very similar and they've made suddle changes each game that makes each one play a bit differently. There are many good things about this game.  One of the best things about the game are the graphics. At first, you might hate them. The first dungeon looks terrible in my opinion, however over the game the graphics improve. Some of the dungeons are extremely well done, and each one has a different style. The character designs themselves are really good. At first I was a little bit put off, but after a few battles they grow on you.  Another great thing about the game is the voice acting. Practically the entire game has voice acting(with the exception of random npcs in towns and a few lines here and there). Senel has a very good voice actor. One of the best I've heard in a long time. Vaclav also has a great voice actor, as he kinda sounds like Jeremy Irons.  The battles are like the other tales games. You run left and right and perform combos. There are some interesting new additions to the battle system. One of them is the ability to combine various abilities into a new ability. You won't do this often, but the new abilities you create can be very powerful against certain creatures.  The story is good. It is cliched, but it is well done. There are interesting characters and a very interesting relationship between the main character and his sister. The game is long enough so you develop a lasting attacthment to the characters.  I would highly reccomend that any fan of the Tales games picks this up. I don't think it will stand the test of time, but it's definetly a great RPG right now."

B00004S99S_25258	Reviews_Video_Games	"...but not without its faults. Jet Grind Radio is getting comparisons to both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Crazy Taxi--and it's obvious as to why. The jumping and grinding the rails, the tricks, and the skating vibe has more than its share of Tony Hawk in it. The arrows that direct you, the nonstop action, and the way it plays is very much like Crazy Taxi. So is Jet Grind Radio basically those two games put together? No! Definitely not. The characters and the graphics are superior to those two games put together, and the tagging element is original. My biggest complaint is the control--it's pretty lame. The A button is to jump, the R button is to accelerate, and the L button is used to both guide the camera and tag. The three left over buttons aren't used. Duh, Sega! It's so frustrating using the L button when trying to tag the bosses (I'll get to this later) and instead it refocuses your camera. There's no brake button either, which isn't too important, but would have been nice. What also bothered me was the lack of a two player option. WHY would Sega not put that option in here? Jet Grind Radio could've been one of my all-time favorite games had there been the option of two players. Ah, yes...my nemesis that plagues video games everywhere--the camera. It's bad enough that there's a cheap camera/tag button, but the camera has a way of screwing up like they always do. But what about the good points, you say? There's plenty of those, let me tell you... While I usually shy away from starting my praises with the graphics (they're not as important as gameplay, ya know), I can't really help it here. The graphics in Jet Grind Radio are simply astonishing. The cel-shaded world of Jet Grind Radio is unbelievable. Just watching this game looks like you're watching a cartoon--actually, that would be an insult the game. Jet Grind Radio looks better than the cartoons US companies put out (not on par with anime, but we can't have it all, I suppose). It makes Disney look like crayon books in motion. Unbelievable, I tell you, unbelievable. Next would be the gameplay. Addicting comes to mind, so does amazing. But the word that describes Jet Grind Radio best is FUN. I haven't had this much single player fun for my Dreamcast since, well... when was the last time I had this much fun? Yes, this is more addicting than Shenmue, and I think it belongs up there in ranks with it. I can't tell you how much fun it is grinding down a rail at top speed, leaping through the air like a superhero, and then tagging the wall. Sweet. The music to Jet Grind Radio is more quirky hip-hop than anything, and it easily fits the game (and, yes, I like it). There's some cuts from real artists such as Rob Zombie (why did they label him industrial though? Duh!), Jurassic 5, Mix Master Mike, Cold, and more. Some are complaining about this since (most of) the J-pop is gone from the import--I say good riddance, as I hate J-pop. But the music in this game is catchy (and even though I am a Rob Zombie fan, it still seems odd putting him in this game. Still a good [remixed] song though), and I enjoyed it very much. The characters are great, too. My personal favorite was Cube, of course (us Goths are neglected in games, so it's nice to see one in here--plus she's cute, heh). She has become one of my favorite video game characters of all time--she's cool, she's hip, and, well, she's a Goth. But I loved ALL the characters in this game, they all have an irresistable charm to them, and even the bad guys were great (Love Shockers!). One has to wonder why Beat is the main character though (I love the guy, but him over, say, Cube or Combo? Please). I would have prefered having Cube and Combo (you gotta love the fact that Combo skates with a boombox kicking out ""phat jams"") didn't come out so late in the game though--as they were my two favorite characters--but that's alright, I suppose. Like they should, the characters all have different statistics. One may be better at tagging, one might be faster, while the other might have a bigger life bar; so experimenting with the different characters is key here. Speaking of life bar, something that Tony Hawk or Crazy Taxi didn't have was enemies. At times this can get annoying seeing as how your only real defense is to flea, but they add a challenge to the game. There are all sorts of enemies that chase you--from tanks, to helicopters, to losers running up and tackling you, there's a fair amount of baddies to avoid. Te bosses can get annoying though, as you have to tag three of them onthe back--and like everything else you do, you're on a timer. They always knock you down and take off, this gets frustrating when you need one more tag and they knock you down and you die. The length of the game isn't very long, actually, but for some reason this didn't bother me, as I keep going back to it for more. All in all, Jet Grind Radio is one of the best games for the Dreamcast yet. It has a decent challenge, great characters, great dialogue, the option of creating your own graffiti, and it leaves you with a strong addiction due to its infectious, semi-original gameplay (and hey, there's even some more levels than the Japanese version...although I wish they stuck with the original name, Jet Set Radio). A must own masterpiece that deserves to be in EVERY Dreamcast owners' library. I cannot wait for Jet Grind Radio 2--Sega just better leave Cube in though if they know what's good for 'em."

B0009UBR3K_145385	Reviews_Video_Games	I got this game and a Nintendo DS two days ago, and so far everything is good. The game is a little hard at first, trying to figure out everything, but the more you play it the easier it becomes. The first thing you do in this game is pick your dog, it's breed and gender. There is a little discription describing the dog's breed then the personality of the dog you want to buy. All the dog's cost about $500-$600. I picked a Shy Female Shih Tzu and named her Roxy. You only start out with one dog. You have to earn money by entering contests and getting top 3. If you don't get top three, you don't get any money and you drop down a level. I won First Place Twice in Agility, which is definetly the easiest one (in my opinion). You can take your puppy for walks and it can socialize with other dogs. Today, i took my puppy to a park and there were two other dogs there. You can also use bark mode and find a DS Nintendog in your area (i tried that, and i couldn't find any) There are alot of things you can buy your Nintendog, collers, bows, hats, food (dry and canned), water, guide books, toys (bubble machine) sports toys (frizby, which you need for the frizby compitetion, and tennis balls) and so much more. If you have more than one puppy (which i don't, but i'm getting another Shih Tzu, a male) you can drop them off at the dog hotel. You can also donate dogs. If the game is turned on and your ignoring your dog, it will start to cry, back up and turn away from you. You should feed your Nintendog three times a day; in the morning, afternoon, and at night - water and dry or canned food - because it gets hungry very often. You can also get milk for your puppy. You can only enter three contests a day, and you can't take your dog(s) for walks alot (it won't let you anyway) because it will be very tired, and it will be very very thirsty, and have to drink alot of water afterwards, which isn't good if you are trying to save money/supplies (like me) On walks, there are many places to go. To the agility park, and various other parks. Your puppy will meet others along the way. Also, sometimes, your puppy may eat garbage (you can't stop them if it is on their walking trail) But don't worry, because your dog will get better within 20 seconds. The dog breed that costs the least is a beagle ($510), and the dog breed that costs the most is a pug ($590). The animation is so realistic, my Video Game Shih Tzu looks like my real life Shih Tzu. I definetly recomend buying this game. A ton of fun; and the disc is so small, it's hard to beleive all of it is on that little disc.  January 31, 2006 A great game,  I reviewed Nintendogs about a month ago, when i first got the game. Scince then, i have discovered alot about this game. First i'll start off by saying, this game is really easy to play. Basicly all you do is pick a puppy and raise it. You can walk it, feed it, play fetch, buy things for it, and so much more. You can take it for walks and find useful (most of the time) items, that it picks up along the way. To get alot of presents, be sure to go over alot of question marks (when your drawing your walking route) because that means more presents (or dogs). You can enter your dogs in contests as well. There are three types of contests (though i might get more on this game once i play it a little more) Obediance (when you get to show the tricks you taught your dog) disc (or frisbee, your dog will catch the frisbee and bring it back to you.) and agility (a corse set up with alot of different things your puppy has to run through, jump over, ect. You have to train very hard for these contests, especially agility, because even if you get an exelent score, and you get alot of faults, you won't get the place you hoped for. You can win money in these contests, but only if you place 3rd, 2nd, or 1st. For first place prize (in all of the contests) in begginer, is $100. Open class (which comes after) is $200. For expert class, $300, master class is $600, and the championship is $1000 (but only if you do really good) There are a TON of items in this game, and they are sorted into catagories: Acessories, Ect., Sports, toys, clocks, care, and music. There are alot of items you CAN'T buy, that you will eventually find on your walks. Something really neat, though it may take awhile to find these, is that when you find a firemans hat, and a jackrussel book, you will get Dalmations and Jack Russel Terriors. Here is a list of some of the items i have found while walking: Acessories: Pirate hat, sun hat, graduation cap, green hat, blue and red cap, firemans hat, green pearl ribbon, purple pearl ribbon, sport sunglasses, scholar glasses, and many more. Ect: Moai Statue, stick, leather shoe, while boot, promise ring (diamond ring) and many more. Clocks: Marble clock, lucky clock, and many more. Music: records, keyboard, ect. Care: Brushes, food, treats, ect. Sports: disc, bark ball, ect. Toys: Jump rope, pull rope, wind up toy, remote controll cars, ect. If you dont' like the items or they are useless, you can sell them in the second hand shop (located in shopping) and get money for them.  You can teach your dogs many tricks. They are not too hard to teach. If you want to teach your puppy to sit, you just sort of brush down on it's stomach, and it will sit, or lie down. If you want to teach your puppy to shake, just grab it's paw. To teach it a trick, click the light bulb. It will record your voice very quickly, so remember to say it very clearly so your puppy will understand you.  After you get your first puppy at the beggining, you can go to the kennel and get another puppy, after you save up some money. You can have up to eight dogs, five at the dog hotel and three at home. There are a few breeds to pick from on your game when you first start. After a while you will start to get more breeds ( i have all the dog breeds already).  You can also change the style of your home, but it is quite expensive. Along with getting new dog breeds you will also get new styles to do your house in.  Overall.. This is a really great game to play. My review might have made this game look hard to play, but it is really easy, and a ton of fun, too.	I won First Place Twice in Agility, which is definetly the easiest one (in my opinion).	59:66	700:707	Nintendogs Dachshund &amp; Friends		easiest		Agility	contests, ENVIRONMENT=Nintendogs Dachshund & Friends	contests	difficulty	negative	y		
B000NIFBA8_110037	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	Recently,  I have purchased several dozen of the Stanley FatMax Tools for my Sons ... and a set for me.  Each one is crafted out of the finest hardened metals and the hand-guard on each chisel is very useful.  All you need to do is hit your hand with a small sledge hammer as is slips off a 'standard' Chisel [operator being a bit careless] ... and you'll wish you had one of these quality guards to prevent hurting your hand.  It works well.  As mentioned,  I have purchased several dozen FatMax hand tools.  The prices are very competitive and the quality is always first rate.  One of my sons is an Engineer in Building Construction and the other is a Construction Professional. These tools are used on a weekly basis.  Each loves the Fat Max products.

B0016J2CYQ_156029	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I purchased this thermostat to control a Cadet 63314 heater I installed in a cold bathroom in our house. I wanted a programmable unit because, being a bathroom, I didn't need the room to be a constant temperature all day... I wanted it warm in the morning when I got up, and again at night when getting ready for bed. Also, I didn't want the electric bill running up to heat a room I wasn't in for several hours a day. This is the only programmable line voltage unit I could find, and is does an excellent job. Multiple settings through the day to manage the room temp. for when you want it, and day of the week settings to allow your days to be set differently. Also has a vacation button that you can set for a different temp., without changing any other programming. Programming was easy, though you will need to refer to the instructions because of the number of options on settings. The preset programming is very good though, so you may not need to adjust anything other than the time and day. The hardest part of the install was running the wiring. Since this is a line voltage thermostat, you will need to run 240v power to it, then away from it to the heater, which can be a lot of work if you are doing it in a finished room, as I was. This has made a huge difference in the comfort of the bathroom it was installed in, and I recommend it for anyone who might have, or is installing, a baseboard heater. The electrical savings, plus comfort, made this a big winner for me.

B000KKNZG6_98613	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	It takes a lot of patience to work with. Go slow and keep soaking wet and you will be okay. I used dollar store baby shampoo in ro water for my spray bottle, a kobalt utility knife and a generic bondo spreader as my squeegee. Was able to do two large windows solo. A majority of the time was spent with the squeegee getting everything smooth.  It really does work and quite well. My living room in az has some windows that get direct sun most of the day that already had outdoor screens on them and the room was always much hotter than the rest of the house. I put the tint on two of the biggest culprits and the room stays noticeably cooler.

B000PDOOA4_117983	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I think Rolair makes the best compressors on the market. I've had this unit for about 18 months now and it has performed flawlessly. When remodeling a house with a few people I put a manifold on it so we could run a floor nailer, 15 gauge nailer, and a framer all at the same time. This did not strain the compressor at all; it kept up just fine. It is the quietest compressor I have ever owned, and probably one of the quietest I have ever used. Rolair makes a good product and I think I am going to purchase one of their larger compressors for my garage. I was also considering the IR twin-stack, but I read about some quality control problems IR was having with their compressors and decided against it. No regrets with the Rolair. I think I have seen this exact same compressor at Mendard's branded as a Masterforce. FYI...Masterforce also places their name on Stabila levels.

B0000DCBKN_28771	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	The Porter Cable 890 series router is the obvious choice in the 1 3/4 - 2 1/2 HP fixed/plunge category.  No other router combos offer so many features. The plunge base is ergonomically designed.  Soft start really comes in handy here, making any handheld operation much easier.  Dust Collection through the base works very well and catchs 95% of all dust. The design of the unit allows for maximum visibility from various angles.  You can set three different plunge depths and swith between them in seconds, greatly reducing the number of set ups needed to perform multiple routes on a project while increasing accuracy and consistency. The fixed base is functional and well machined.  I've made several extra base plates for my router (a surfacing plate, a fractioning plate, a circle cutter, and most importantly for the fixed base is the router table plate).  I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to adjust the router depth from the top of my router table.  I don't have to crane my arm around to get at a lift.  I can watch the bit and make micro-adjustments to the depth with simple turn of the depth adjuster wrench. The unit switches between bases with ease and locks in securely.  One hand bit changes are a snap and can be perform in seconds, even in my router table.  The 890 series router also kicks up the amprage when the router gets bogged down, so it maintains desired RPMS during the heaviest of workloads.  What's more, the router is extremely quiet (the quietest I've ever heard of any kind). Getting a new router made me remember how versatile the tool is.  If you're going to make new base plates the base uses three 10-24 screws that can be bought for pennies at your local hardware store.  Making base plates isn't rocket science but it requires precision and can open up a world of possibilities for your router and woodworking projects. I did extensive research before purchasing my 895, it is quite simply the top of the line.  Makita and Bosch offer the only real competition, they both make very nice combos in their own right, but the PC is superior.  You'll have no regrets.	What's more, the router is extremely quiet (the quietest I've ever heard of any kind).	49:57	1478:1486	PORTER-CABLE 895PK 12 Amp 2-1/4-Horsepower Fixed and Plunge Base		quietest		HEAR(e, EXPERIENCER=I, STIMULUS=the 890 series router)	HEAR(e, EXPERIENCER=I, STIMULUS=routers)	#2=STIMULUS	noise	negative	y

B000J43A7W_94159	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I purchased the R3 Jr for use on building a hardwood table so I knew I would be putting it to the test from day one. I will say this system clamps things together beautifully. My largest clamps are only 3 foot and having to buy 8 x 48 inch clamps at about 30$ a piece would come to about 240$ just to properly hold my table top together as the glue dried. This effectively saved me about 150$ just in that one instance. Not to mention I was able to immediately raise the table top and move it where I wanted it.  The cherry table top is dense and its size 36x72 as listed in the Kreg directions (every 6 inches) requires 11 holes per board which comes to 44 holes. For ease of use I just went to punch them all out in one sitting rather than stopping to glue and screw. On the second board (11 consecutive holes) the bit started to feel snug in the metal sleeve as if heat from the constant friction was causing things to expand and seize up. Naturally to seat the bit properly I spun up the drill a bit and just kept powering through. It wasn't Until I was through that second board (22 holes) that I flipped the jig over and noticed a fracture in the blue plastic that held the metal sleeve in place... which was now about a centimeter or 2 recessed into the jig. I simply switched to the second hole for the rest of the 22 holes and although I experienced the same slight binding of the drill bit I was able to finish without incident. Keep in Mind I was not putting pressure on the drill I was letting it walk itself into the wood as this was my first experience with this Jig so I was being as delicate as possible.  Needless to say I am having Amazon replace the jig and I will see how the second jig works for the skirt and legs of the table putting it through the same stress test.  *UPDATE* The replacement jig worked perfectly for the next 40 or so holes. Again this jig is what everyone makes it out to be. An amazing tool that makes life much simpler if you never plan to look at the pocketholes.

Looked like it would fit my hand well...you can't really tell when everything is in a clamshell...no more hold the knife before you buy it.  So I made the purchase of $14.99 plus tax and came home and started whittling.  I posted pics of my first two projects  The knife came nicely sharpened from the factory.  I bought a Flexcut Slipstrop here on Amazon and stropped the knife with the compound.  It stropped a nice edge.  I got quite a bit of detail from the small blade and that surprises me, as well as the fact that the carving is recognizable surprises me.  I am encouraged.  This is wonderful little knife for whittling and one that you can keep handy.  I didn't want something that was heavy, this knife weighs 1.68 ounces and is comfortable to hold for the whittling duration.

As a mechanic, I used my Klein Linesman Side Cutters (bought in 1987 as an electrician) often, but I used them to cut bolts, steel hangers and such. Their cutters still were sharp enough to cut and strip wire (the half of the cutter closest to the pivot was dull due to over a decade of abuse mentioned above, but the far side half was still sharp enough to cut 18 gauge strand in one easy squeeze). I lost them in December 08 and replaced them with a $65 pair of Snap-On side cutters. I LOVE Snap-On hand tools, but their side cutters are not as good as Klein's. Although they are the same size, Snap-Ons' don't have as much cutting power and the handles flex more when cutting hard objects.

Sure, it's a slow partial turn of the screw with the offset tool, but it gets in the gap to the screw and allows plenty of leverage to turn it (the largest driver is about 5 1/2"" long; the middle size about 4""), so long as sufficient pressure is applied at the end to keep the screwdriver tip from coming up out of the screw head slots as the driver is turned.  My only complaint is that the ends aren't even shorter than they are, which would allow even greater access to even tighter spots.  The largest driver is about an inch and a half from the phillips tip to the top of the curved end, while the middle size is about an inch and an eighth.  The small size is only about an inch from tip to top of bend.  All in all a good set."

B00006WNMI_23110	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I had the Pur Faucet filter system (not the Snap on one) and after a few filter refills the housing cracked and leaked.  Thinking this was a flaw in their design I replaced it with the Brita Faucet Filter system.  I HATED it from the day I installed it.  The filters were expensive and the knob to turn the filter on and off was near impossible to grasp and turn.  I had purchased it with 4 filters as a box set and even though I had one more filter left I could not wait to get rid of it and buy a faucet filter that was easy to turn on and off and was affordable.  Enter the Culligan Level 3 filter.  1) Extremely easy to install.  2) Extremely easy to turn on (just pull out the knob with little effort.  3) East to shut off (either push the knob in with little effort or shut off the water and it resets to normal unfiltered mode).  4) AFFORADABLE!  Finally an affordable good tap filter that works easily and reliably.  One thing about the filter is it is not the most esthetically designed unit, but none of them are great looking and all of them are hanging off a sink faucet.  Otherwise, this unit gives the best bang for the buck and is easiest to use.  Another plus is that you can get in on the auto-shipments and save even more and time them so when they arrive it coincides with the correct timing to replace the filter.

B0000225XN_5356	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	Here's the trick  It took me a bit of trial and error but here's the easiest was to set it up.  You need some test blocks.  4 at a minimum and you're probably going to need more of the exact thickness your final stock is going to be.  For the final result you're going to need to run one edge horizontal and one vertical against the fence.  So the difficulty in adjustment is height and fence position.  Don't try to adjust both at the same time.  First run 2 cuts horizontal (board flat on the table) flip one board over and fit the jointed edges together.  They should be flush; if they are not raise or lower until they are flush.  If the boards are proud your not deep enough if they are recessed your to deep.  Once you have this dimension flush move onto the vertical (boards up against the fence).  You can repeat the exact same technique for getting the fence position just right.  Once you think you've got it run some fresh edges in the horizontal and vertical just to make sure and your should have a perfect miter corner.  Now save and label and these test blocks for future setups.  If you need to miter the same thickness material again your final test blocks will make setup again a breeze.  I needed to do several fake beams along the ceiling the some corners.  Doing 10' miters is tough own but this bit made it much easier during assembly.  Be aware of grain direction and make sure you not going against it; you will tear out and possible wreck your miter.

Most water saving designs are noticeably weak, and therefore frustrating.  One would probably have to speak to a flow dynamics physicist to know why, but I can definitely say I don't notice a real difference in water pressure or quantity.  I know it is restricting the flow only because the water takes a longer to get warm.  (Which makes sense, the cold water is in your pipes and when flow is ample, then the cold water escapes quickly, restricted flow would result in the cold water escaping in a longer time frame)  I would have given a 5 star, but the cone shape is a bit large for the comparatively small functional area needed for the spicket area.  It could have been reduced, unless the large shape was the intent of the designer.

B001349MD8_174529	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	"I admit this was a just an impulse buy that threw in the cart with a slightly larger pocket Multi-tool.  I didn't do much looking at it since I've never owned or used a Gerber Knife I didn't like.  I just bought it because I liked the idea of a super compact key-chain tool that I could use to open packages from Amazon when I don't happen to have a real knife in my pocket. (And an extra gizmo never hurts).   My first thought when I opened the package was ""Wow that's huge"" it has the same closed length as the Gerber Crucial that I received in the same shipment, this could be ok but based on the odd shape I can't imagine how it might dig into my leg if I actually dared attach it to my keys.  My second thought was ""well as long as it's handy I'll at least put it on my key-chain and give it a try"". When I attempted to open the small blade (a disposable X-acto that comes with replacements) I couldn't get it open. It is true that I'm not a body builder, but I am a bass player, so I do have decently strong fingers. With the slightest hint of oil from a tortilla chip it might as well have been welded shut, to get it to open the first time I had to pry it open with the screwdriver from the Gerber Crucial. Now that I have all the chip residue off my hands, if I use both hands I can get it open, but why would anyone want a key-chain tool that takes two grown-man hands to open?   Before I get hecklers saying they got the same tool and it opened like butter, I will admit that this may just be a defect in this one tool, I will be removing the lock spring with the small nubbin that keeps the think closed, If I remove some of the nubbin and take a little spring out of the lock I might make it useful yet, but overall I call this a failure, I guess even Gerber isn't perfect 100% of the time.    So if you just want the bottle opener and miniature pry-bar go for it, however if you ever intend on using the knife and don't want to modify it or carry a screwdriver to get it open I suggest you pass and find something else.

B000XTH1J6_165782	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I own 3 of the regular Flexogen 8 ply aqua colored hoses and they still work fine after 19 years use, but they have a mildew issue (granted I can easily wipe it off w/ bleach but I'd prefer if I didn't have to do this). I bought this hose to see since it is the latest and greatest version if it would be more mildew resistant. I have not had it long enough to yet determine. I also like the connecting ends better since it reduces stress and hopefully will prevent leaking at the faucet end. This is a solid reputation company that stands behind its product (my neighbor sent one back for a quick replacement).

B000I1KJT8_90591	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I have worked on a number of cooling systems in different brands of vehicles as a preventative measure and sometimes because they are failing. One of the vehicles I have worked on that probably has the most complicated flow of coolant is the Land Rover Discovery 2 series which has over a dozen clamps of various sizes holding coolant hoses at awkward access angles.  I dreaded working on these vehicles' cooling systems in the past because it takes hours just to get to and undo the clamps with inventive cuss' words but this tool makes it so much quicker.  This tool saved me hours on a single job.  This tool works by having the cable end, not the plier end, that has sliding mechanism which squeezes the hose's clamp handle thereby opening it up.  If you have worm screw type clamps, this instrument will do you no good. It will only work for the tension clamp type.  A few gripes I have with this tool are:  1. How wide the grip becomes making it difficult to get the plier start gripping with one hand as you have the other hand holding the mechanism on the clamp when the clamp is large.  2. It won't hold the grip when you are ready to slide the clamp away from the fitting along the hose once you squeezed the handle on the plier.  I can see that it is designed to just do that yet but it doesn't because of the way the gear on the red lever attached on the handle (see stock photo) mates to the hinge gear on the pliers very poorly.  You can still use the tool but you have to have one hand squeezing the plier so you only have one hand free if you are working by your self.  I would have given 3.5~4 stars because it helped so much but I feel like the feature that is supposed to work just doesn't work hence not a perfect score minus one star for non working feature and one more for the wide grip not allowing one hand to be free to get the large clamp squeezed.  I still recommend this tool.

B000BX1JQU_66039	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I received my Powermatic 701 Bench Mortiser on Friday from Amazon (WMH Tool). No damages. Over the weekend I set it up and made 12 mortises in red oak table legs. Wow!  Powermatic makes the heaviest, most powerful power tools in the professional woodworking market - period. First, this thing weighs about 80 pounds. It's iron castings are massive. The arm and column on which the motor and quill are mounted are like bridge supports. I looked at the competitor's machines and they're like toys compared to this one. The cast iron table is huge, thick and perfectly flat.  The fence system is great - lots of ways to secure the workpiece with a heavy cast fence that moves back and forth on slots in the table keeping it perfectly 90 degrees to the head. The fence locks down and won't move or flex. And the hold down is the best one I've seen. The rolling front locking wheels are great.  The motor (3/4 HP) is the largest in the class. And it hums like a kitten. Love that PM power. Once my chisels were sharp, this machine allowed me to make easy mortises in the hard oak. Chop, chop.  The arm mechanism can be mounted on the left or right and feels solid once you set it in place. It takes a lot of punishment as does the excellent rack and pinion gear set it moves on. The depth stop is also solid.  I was going to put this unit on my workbench and move it around when I needed to use it - wrong! It's just too darn heavy. So I mounted it to a piece of 3/4 inch plywood and now it's permanently mounted to the top of my rolling tool chest.  At nearly $475.00 it's by far the most expensive bench mortiser. This is true of all Powermatic tools - they are the high end. I have a PM2000 table saw and 54A 6-inch jointer in addition to this beauty. They were all more expensive then the competition. But if you're a serious woodworker or a professional furniture maker, this is your machine.  OK, one minor gripe - there should be a way to immobilize the arbor shaft so you can more easily tighten and loosen the chuck. Not a huge deal but would be an improvement.  Powermatic tools are bought once and last forever (and then you give them to your son or grandson and so on). Spend the money now and you'll be a happy mortiser for a long, long time.

B0000222V1_1049	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	"Porter Cable 42000 Template Guide Kit  I've had a 42000 template guide kit since the mid 1990's.  The set works OK, but my advice is to buy another brand.  The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators.  In addition, after a dozen years or so, every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows, pits and all. It's not clear why this happened, since they've never been outside the basement workshop, and no other tools corroded.  The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts. Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion, but the pieces still look dreadful.  The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs, such as the Leigh jig.  It's possible to modify them to work with these jigs, by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides, flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth.  A no-cost approach.  If you want steel guides, the Milwaukee's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case, and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C's.  Unfortunately, the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigs  In any case, brass is a better material for guides than steel, because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide.  Once, near a day's end of routing doors for hinges, my template's locking ring came loose, allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit, and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut.  Since the guide and ring were brass, no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred.  Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring, the bit or router could have been damaged.  Try ""brass router template"" via Goggle - and buy a kit made of solid brass, in a decent case, for less money than this set.  Also check out the Woodstock International H3134 Brass Bushing set at Amazon."

You should now be staring at a screwed in plunger system with white cap.  8. Use your socket wrench and new and expensive thin-walled socket to remove the plunger assembly. It can a little stiff at first, but loosens quickly. Take it out.  9. I assume your plunger assembly is stick and gooey. So, let's take it apart and clean it. First, notice the white cap on top and small white piece on bottom. It is one piece. Hold the plunger and push on the bottom side, where the small white piece is. This can be hard. I hold the assembly with my left hand, and use one end of my needle nose pliers to push on the small white piece. The white plunger has some small o rings on it that add resistance. Once you get that out, remove the spring of the main piece of metal. And take of the o-ring, save it if you like, but you are much better off chucking it and using a new one. I learned this the hard way, yes they can leak.  10. Put the spring and metal piece in straight vinegar for many hours, if not overnight.  11. I just wipe down the white plunger with water and a paper towel, maybe some soap.  12. After the soaking time, your pieces may be perfectly clean. IYou may want to use a towel, q-tip, etc. to wipe the insides off and get and dislodge goo out of there. Rinse off all in water and set aside.  13. Put new o-rings on the metal piece.  14. Reverse the process and put it back together. The hardest part is right at then end. In order to put the handle back on and be able to screw in the final piece with the wrench, you have to press really hard on the plunger to get it pressed down some. It can take several tries. Sometimes i will use a small screwdriver or something to press on the plunger to get it moving, then use the other hand with the handle and other parts to add pressure while I take the other hand, grab the wrench, and finish it off.

B000N8OYXI_108598	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	40,000 people die every year as a result of Carbon Monoxide posioning. Why? Because they don't have a CO alarm. My sister and her boyfriend just bought their first house together and neither one of them are exactly the sharpest tools in the shed. They had been living in their new place less than an hour--Yes, I said hour as in 60 minutes-- and they already had every smoke detector in the house ringing. They had set something in the microwave on fire. Now, normal, sensable, people purchase safety equipment for their home either before or almost immediately after moving in, in case of emergency; my sister went out and bought porch lights because the ones in front were silver and she wanted black. My sister doesn't exactly think about safety first she more does something and then later trys to figure out what went wrong. So, with smoke detecors firmly in place, I figured it was my job (you know, as the younger sister) to go out and purchase CO Alarms for their house...before an accident occurs. This model seemed to not only be the simplest model(and in this case the simpler the better) on the market, but it also appeared to be the most effective while being the simplest. It mounts easily to the wall and comes complete with the two needed batteries. What surprised me the most was that the batteries were Energizers and not some cheap unknown brand from some underground third world sweat shop. So I know they'll last a while until its time to change the clocks back again. I know that instructions (on some models) say not to install near a Boiler, Basement, or Kitchen, but it my opinion if something is going to start leaking CO, its more than likely those are going to be the points of origin. So to be on the safe side, just like in my own home, I installed one on every level of the house. Because really, which would you rather see: The sun rise another day or The inside of a body bag?

B00002N6T5_6620	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	"The Case Yellow Synthetic Stockman w/Punch Medium is the best knife I've found which manages to bridge two very different worlds with two very different, often conflicting sets of considerations; namely, the everyday professional workplace and the wilderness camp setting. Its size and impressively versatile blade set make it a reliable and capable companion in both settings. With the exception of the airport, I will probably never go anywhere without this knife in my pocket.  The brilliance of this knife becomes increasingly clearer the longer you own and use it. Understand that I've owned a lot of knives... a LOT of knives. Right now, sitting on my desk are a few of my favorites: a Cold Steel American Lawman, a Swiss Army Small Tinker, a Swiss Army Camper II, a customized Kabar/Becker BK7, a Mora Companion Heavy Duty, a Mora Classic No. 2, a Ken Onion/Kershaw Leek... the list goes on. However, with the exception of the BK7 and the Mora Companion HD (which I use solely for bushcraft/camping), I have carried each of these knives for months or years at a time, but none has proven ideal for my unusually wide spectrum of everyday knife tasks. That's because my ""every day"" activities run an unusually broad spectrum, from an administrative leadership role in a very weapons-sensitive environment (a university campus) to hiking/backpacking/camping/bushcraft outings in the wilderness.  For wilderness outings, my primary blade is usually the Mora Companion HD or BK7; however, even with those capable knives in hand, I always carry a smaller, backup blade for miscellaneous camp chores (food preparation, carving/whittling, etc.). I have numerous smaller blades that excel in that role, but as soon as I transition back to a professional or social environment, they begin to pose various drawbacks. For example, the American Lawman is an outstandingly capable blade for most utility and self defense needs; however, it is too large, black, and intimidating to use in the midst of my colleagues at the university. In fact, though I have carried it there many times, I find myself reluctant to pull it out of my pocket when the need arises. Academia is a very politically sensitive environment, so even though the American Lawman is no more dangerous than any of the hundred other pocket knives I grew up using as a kid, it would have raised eyebrows and possibly even elicited a few anonymous reports to Public Safety about ""concerning behavior."" You get the idea.  Of all the previous blades I've tried for EDC at work, the Small Tinker came closest to ideal, but its wonderful pocketability required a tradeoff of limited functionality with its small blade. Swiss Army steel is surprisingly good for whittling, but when it came to other camp chores like food prep, it felt a little strained in that role. Plus, I wasn't really using the other tools except for the toothpick and tweezers, so I would have preferred, for the same weight, to have an additional blade or else a thicker main blade.  Then I found the Case Yellow Synthetic Stockman with Punch (Medium), which fits all my needs absolutely perfectly--indeed, much better than I expected. At last, I have a knife that I can drop in my pocket EVERY day, no matter where I'm going or what I'm doing, with no concern about the irrational reactions of others, nor any feeling that I am underequipped for the kinds of cutting tasks that arise throughout my day. I'm truly elated.  Here is the secret to this knife's winning recipe:  SUPERB POCKETABILITY-TO-USEFULNESS RATIO Some small knives carry great, but are so small or thin they compromise your grip and feel awkward to use. Others fit wonderfully in your hand, but feel bulky or weigh down your pocket, especially while wearing dress pants. At 3-5/8"" long and a scant 64 grams (2.3 ounces), the Medium Stockman has a form factor that is about as good as it gets for all around utility. It virtually disappears into my pocket so that I forget it's there; yet when I need it, it is EXACTLY the right length to facilitate a full, confident grip for my medium sized hands, affording plenty of comfort and leverage, especially when whittling. Since it is relatively narrrow, it doesn't quite fill the hand the way a larger fixed blade knife handle typically would, but for a pocket knife, it allows an unusually secure grasp nonetheless--and thanks to the handle design, it allows a reverse grip for controlled, high force cutting by leveraging your arms against your chest in a ""pulling apart"" motion (a common bushcraft/carving technique for deep cuts in dense wood to remove material quickly, but hard to explain in writing).  SUPERBLY VERSATILE BLADE SET The three blades on this model complement each other remarkably well. Usually, the Stockman pattern has a third blade (typically, a spey or pen style) instead of the awl/punch. In my experience, however, the inclusion of the punch makes this knife much more useful/versatile. While the edge of the awl is not sharpened, per se, it is ground with a chisel-like edge (rather like one blade of a scissors), so it excels as a makeshift scraper (such as when you wish to scrape a tenacious parking sticker off your windshield, for instance). With its very sharp point, it easily pierces heavy materials (e.g., to add a hole to tighten your belt, or to make a lanyard hole in a whittled tent peg). It's also great for cleaning dirt out from under your nails, and with great care, it makes an effective toothpick (but don't try this where someone could bump into you--the tip of this punch is SHARP!). Lastly, it can serve passably well as a makeshift marlinspike (splicing fid) for rope splicing and loosening knots, though in that role you have to use care since it does have a moderately hard edge unlike a true, rounded profile splicing fid, and thus, could damage the cordage if not used gently.  The other two blades are typical to the Stockman pattern, and they are excellent as well. The clip point is a very good slicer and has a sufficiently aggressive tip for moderate piercing tasks, such as coring an apple or piercing a half-frozen piece of meat so you can skewer it on a stick to roast over an open fire. The sheepsfoot blade is great for whittling. Its smooth rounded spine makes a comfortable place to park your thumb to apply pressure and the rounded tip minimizes the risk of stabbing yourself if you slip with the blade. For the same reason, the sheepsfoot is also great for cutting open boxes and clamshell packaging. As a further benefit, its broader, rounded tip makes it passably good at spreading tasks also (butter, jam, etc.).  All together, you have a wonderfully versatile tool set! I can't think of a better combination of blades for an EDC pocket knife.  EXCELLENT MATERIALS AND FIT/FINISH The clip and sheepsfoot blades are made from Case's wonderful chrome vanadium (equivalent to 1095 high carbon), which sharpens easily to a true razor edge and holds that edge very well. The awl/punch, meanwhile, is made from Case's TruSharp surgical stainless (equivalent to 440A stainless). Some folks may not like the fact that only two of the blades will patina, but the punch will not (it will stay shiny and new looking). I'm not bothered by that. Since the punch doesn't need to hold an edge, it may as well enjoy the anti-corrosion benefits of stainless. For the other two blades, however, I would only accept chrome vanadium, as it is vastly superior to the TruSharp when it comes to ease of sharpening and retaining a sharp edge. With an occasional, light coat of food-grade mineral oil, the chrome vanadium will resist corrosion very well.  The rest of the knife is constructed with nickel bolsters, brass liners, and Case's classic-looking yellow synthetic (delrin) handles/scales. The fit and finish is superb, with not even a hairline gap between the handles, liners, or backsprings. There are undoubtedly variances from one knife to the next since these are hand crafted, but mine sure wasn't made on a Monday morning or a Friday afternoon. It looks great. While the delrin handles are not as fancy or striking as some of the sexier bone handle options from Case, they were my top choice for a knife that's going to live in my pocket and be carried into the woods as well as the office. With delrin, you never have to worry about the handles loosening. The synthetic will never expand/contract, and based on older Case knives I've seen, it ages well also. It just works--and frankly, it looks nice, especially in person. (The pictures don't do it justice.) I like it a lot.  As usual with most Case knives, the backspring tension on every blade is PERFECT. Each blade has sufficient tension to pull it snugly against the frame when the blades are closed (they will NOT open by accident in your pocket), yet light enough that your fingernail does not deflect or get mangled when you use the nail nicks to open each blade. The action is smooth, not gritty or stiff, and you only feel the pressure of the backspring resisting, not the clumsier feel of binding joints or poorly machined liners. Moreover, the spring tension is virtually nonexistent for about 90 degrees of each blade's travel (from the moment it sweeps more than 45 degrees from its open or closed position). This wide ""dead zone"" of spring non-tension in the sweep of the blade is an important safety feature that minimizes the risk of the blade snapping shut on your fingers if it starts to close; however, unlike some other Case knives, mine does not have a dedicated 90-degree detent. (I haven't found that to be a problem.) As each blade comes within 45 degrees or less of its closed or open position, the spring tension kicks in again to snap the blade confidently and securely into place. I should also note that, when the blades are open, the tension holding them open is strong enough that it takes noticeable pressure to start closing the blade, again minimizing the chances that the blade will close on your fingers (unless you misuse it, of course). Awesome.  VERY ATTRACTIVE, VERY NON-THREATENING APPEARANCE/DESIGN Although I don't usually worry over the appearance of my knives, it was an important consideration when I chose this knife because I work in such a sensitive professional environment. Thankfully, everything about this knife's size, shape, color, and style screams ""non-threatening"" (it also screams things like: ""tradition"", ""character"", ""utility"", ""gentlemanly style"", and ""neat-O""). When people see it, they routinely ask about it with fascination/admiration. They do not flinch or knit their brows, nor think any of the fearful thoughts that more ""tactical"" blades tend to conjure up almost reflexively among academics. Best of all, I don't feel as if I had to make an undesirable concession to the politically correct environment in which I work. In fact, I LOVE the way this knife looks, and even when I'm out of the office, I appreciate the sense of tradition and days-gone-by that this knife evokes. It's awesome, and even if I didn't work in such a sensitive environment, I would still choose and enjoy carrying this knife. In fact, I like it so well, I fear I'm on the brink of becoming a collector of these little slipjoints. Hide your wallets folks--it can become an addiction!  I should mention that a slipjoint design and blade configuration like this is also a very good choice when it comes to sketchy knife laws at the state and local levels. I live on the border with another state that considers any ""gravity knife"" to be a concealed weapon that requires a weapons permit. A gravity knife is defined as any knife with which the blade can be deployed simply by the force of gravity (i.e., flicking your wrist hard)--which most good quality modern folding knives will do! They also consider any blade over 2.5"" to be a concealed weapon that requires a weapons permit. My state has much saner laws and I also happen to have a CCW permit for my state, but my state does not have reciprocity with the neighboring state, so my permit does not cover me once I cross the state line. For that reason, I'm pleased that this knife (1) is most definitely not a ""gravity"" knife that can have its blades deployed by flicking it hard, and (2) its longest blade--the clip point--is just a tad shorter than 2.5"". Don't get me wrong: I think those laws are stupid, arbitrary, and unlikely to contribute significantly to public safety, but I'm the law-abiding sort and I like not having to think/worry about what knife I might be carrying when I cross an invisible state line.  QUIBBLES I love this knife, but here are a few small quibbles that others may care about:  - The sheepsfoot blade and the punch rub on each other. It's slight on mine, but may be more pronounced on others, and in relatively short time, it means a small arc-shaped scratch will be inscribed on the side of one or both blades. I don't care. I can keep the handles/bolsters looking nice, and I want the blades to do work, not to look pretty. The issue has no effect on the knife's performance, but perfectionists and collectors may care.  - There is no lock on this knife. That should be obvious, since it is a slipjoint, but some inexperienced knife buyers may not realize that. There is no question that slipjoint knives can be considerably more dangerous than locking and fixed blade knives in the hands of inexperienced users. You have to ensure the blade doesn't close on your fingers. The likeliest scenario in which that happens is during piercing tasks, when pressure applied parallel to the length of the blade can shift off center and suddenly snap the blade shut. The other likely scenario is while whittling near the end of a stick. As you carve away from yourself (always away), but bring the knife back to take another swipe, sometimes people get in a hurry and accidentally bump the spine against the end of the stick as they draw the knife back, causing it to close on their fingers. Watch out and respect the tool! If you do, it will be plenty safe and a trusted companion.  - The ""shield"" (Case logo) is glued, not pinned. Collectors prefer properly pinned shields, since technically a glued shield can eventually loosen and pop off. Again, I don't care. Mine seems well-adhered and I doubt it will come loose, but if it does, it still will not affect the performance of the knife, which is my primary concern. You may feel differently, so now you know.  - This particular model is not the typical Stockman pattern. I mentioned it above, but just to repeat: This model has an awl/punch INSTEAD of a third (spey or pen) blade like most Stockman patterns. I think this is a great tradeoff, but just wanted to call it to your attention again in case you hadn't noticed. It's exactly what I wanted, but make sure this is what you're looking for.  CONCLUSION I could ramble on and on about this knife. I like it that much. But the point is this: If you, too, are looking for a knife that excels in a wide range of roles--especially those that include sensitive environments where knives evoke strong (and irrational) negative connotations--this Case Medium Stockman with Punch is a phenomenal choice for a pocket knife. Not only can you use it without fear around the office, but it might even elicit questions from admiring coworkers and executives. And yet, the utility, versatility, and traditional character are so good that it will be equally at home cutting open ammo boxes at the gun range, whittling sticks at the park, preparing food at camp, or performing light bushcraft tasks in the woods.  A quick note about a handy addition I made: This knife is so nice, I decided to make a little slip case for it by folding a small microfiber cloth in half and sewing up two sides. It keeps the knife from getting scratched by my car keys (or potentially scratching my phone if I happen to swap it to my other pocket) and can also be used to wipe down the knife to keep it clean and stave off corrosion. What I hadn't realized--but now rejoice at--is that this case can also be used to clean my glasses or wipe fingerprints off the screen of my phone and tablet PC. It's like adding a whole new layer of usefulness to this already great knife, and it's ALWAYS in my pocket, where it scarcely takes up any additional space!  Seriously, why are you still reading this? Get one! I bet you'll love it! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"	Of all the previous blades I've tried for EDC at work, the Small Tinker came closest to ideal, but its wonderful pocketability required a tradeoff of limited functionality with its small blade.	78:85	2556:2563	Case Medium Yellow CV Stockman with Sheepfoot Blade Pocket Knife		closest		COME_CLOSE(e, ARG1=TRY(e, AGENT=I, THEME=the Small Tinker)_2, ARG2=ideal)	COME_CLOSE(e, ARG1=TRY(e, AGENT=I, THEME=previous blades)_2, ARG2=ideal)	#0=e	extent	positive	n

B0013LO0F6_148037	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	"I purchased this safe as a ""quick access"" safe for my handgun ammo.  When I purchased the handgun (Ruger P95), I picked up a Gun Vault 2000D to store it for quick access.  After reviewing the laws pertaining to guns and in home daycare (which my wife runs), I found that I had to store the ammo in a separate locking safe. Not wanting to drop another $180 on a Gun Vault, I turned to Amazon for a more reasonably priced safe.  After reading plenty of reviews of other safes, I decided on this one.  It has all the features I was looking for, size, keypad lock, silent buttons, and price. After receiving the safe I opened the package and received exactly what is pictured. Setup was a breeze, the override keys work perfectly, batteries are easy to change.  Now on to the ""bad"" things.  Nothing on this list is bad enough for me to tell someone to not purchase it.  There are some things that perfect, and work a little funny, but at the end of the day it is a $50 safe.  You get what you pay for.  As some other reviews have stated the door to the safe takes up a lot of space when it is open.  The battery compartment is a bout 3/8"" thick, and obstructs your hand when you try to reach in the safe. You can get some of that space back by mounting the safe on the edge of a shelf so the door falls completely down. The locking mechanism makes noise, but not enough for me to be concerned.  For me the biggest issue was that there was no 1:1 sized mounting template.  I was able to make one after about 30 minutes of work, but it would have been nice to get one right from the manufacturer.  All in all, it is a good little safe. For $50 it is exactly what I expected."

B0009X8N1Q_56731	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I spent a lot of time researching battery powered backup sumps and for the money, this is the best out there.  For this system, the charger is powerful enough to power the pump by itself even if the battery is dead and it can function as a battery maintainer, not just a trickle charger.  This is important in that it will not overcharge the battery and boil off the battery acid.  Some of the lower quality systems do trickle charging instead, requiring you to check battery fluid levels all the time, which in this day and age is just crazy.  With a battery maintainer, a quality maintenance free battery will last years without issue (you can use any over the counter deep cycle batter- also called marine batteries- as long it will fit in the plastic box, so just get the cheapest name brand at your favorite place to buy batteries eg. autozone, walmart, sears, costco, etc).  The pump itself is probably overkill for my needs, but the cheaper systems fall far to short in terms of the charging system, which will result in far higher costs in terms of replacement batteries and early failure.

B000MUSLCC_107469	Reviews_Tools_and_Home_improvement	I have been researching the best tool for keeping my black lab's nails under control. I gave up on trimming them myself a few years ago because I cut into the quick (more than once) using traditional dog grooming nail clippers.

A dremel tool seemed like the best option for us. But, once I came to this conclusion, I discovered the VAST number of tools geared toward pet manicures. The worst thing, however, was that all of them seem to have issues... Faulty parts, weak motors, terrible battery life. I started looking at professional grade corded Dremels, but the cost is prohibitive (for me, at least). Thank goodness for this tool! The Black and Decker is PERFECT.

The flywheel provides inertia to simulate a road feel, such that you can ""coast"" for a bit.  The fluid-based resistance unit is the closest thing to riding outside.

The first one was a ""turbo"" fan based trainer from the 90's, which was MUCH louder.

B0001WC87A_9473	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"I own this very same knife and have for many years.  I have always liked Smith and Wesson knives and have very rarely been disappointed in any of them.  The knife itself in this set is just about the best boot knife I have ever come across.  Not only is the blade made of a thick strong steel, but the handle itself is by far the most comfortable and quality made one I have ever held in a boot knife.  Most boot knives are designed like a dagger, with a two sided blade.  This one is different in that its more like a skinner, with the handle being a thicker more conformed grip than any other I have come across.  It holds a very sharp edge and stays that way through some very heavy cutting with it.  Unfortunately the down side of this knife is its all important sheath.  For a S&W model it is a downright embarrassment.  Its particularly disappointing since the knife itself as noted before is a personal favorite of mine and of a heavy quality.  I tried really hard to make the sheath on this baby work for I liked the knife so much.  The clip on it is cheap and doesn't hold on very well.  And even that wouldn't be so bad if the sheath itself was well designed for removing the knife.  But its just too hard. One has to wiggle the knife out of the sheath in such a way as to turn it right, then straight, and then right again.  Not something you either want to do, or find easy to do when bending over for the whole deal to get at your boot, as is often the case.  In most instances you simply give up and pull the sheath off your boot and extract the knife standing up.  (Which still isn't very easy).  This may be just about the worst sheath combined with the best knife I have come across in a very long time.  I wanted very much to make this knife a regular part of my hiking gear, but I just ended up finally keeping it in my shed for working around the yard with.  I realize of course that all boot knives are supposed to be a little tougher to extract since they can be more easily jarred loose.  But one thats near impossible, or at the very least a pain in the butt of the first order is just as bad.  Unfortunately this fine knife is of such a design that I have never been able to find a better sheath that really fits it.  Which is really too bad for I like the knife a lot and wish that someone at S&W would actually try and remove this knife themselves, for then they would probably see the light and redesign it.  In conclusion I cannot recommend this boot knife, even with the knife itself being a superior one. You will probably end up doing what I did and trying to make it work, and just eventually becoming fed up with it.  If its a really good quality boot knife you want with a truly super sheath system, may I recommend the Columbia River Knife at the enclosed link. Its more expensive, and though the knife is excellent and a good solid carbon steel, I still personally do not like it as much as the S&W.  But its still a very tough quality built knife that comes with a sheath that is truly everything this S&W one isn't.  Its a velcro strap design with a sheath that holds the knife very secure, but also can be extracted with just a good snap of your wrist.  Check it out.  Until S&W decides to redesign this really cool knifes sheath, if ever, I cannot recommend it...  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Columbia-River-Knife-and-Tool-2020-AG-Russell-Sting-Razor-Sharp-Edge-Knife/dp/B00180CYFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Columbia River Knife and Tool 2020 AG Russell Sting Razor Sharp Edge Knife</a>"	Not only is the blade made of a thick strong steel, but the handle itself is by far the most comfortable and quality made one I have ever held in a boot knife.	89:93	330:334	Nonsny  SWHRT1 HRT Tactical Boot Knife, Black		most		Nonsny SWHRT1 HRT Tactical Boot Knife, Black	boot knives	boot knives	comfort	positive	y

B00005OBOY_2689	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	Overall, its a nice gadget and the titanium case is a plus, more for the color (less shiny than the steel version) rather than the weight. I don't think there's a big difference in the weight compared to the stainless steel version, mainly becuase the strap mostly elastomer. On the plus side, this watch includes just about every kind of data you need to be a cyborg and in a cool packaging. Its smaller than a typical Suunto watch which is just nice for everyday use. Previous Suunto watches are just too big. However, the functions can be confusing. Manual is not that helpful either. Just have to get used to the functions. There's so many functions in there it takes time to tweak and learn to use them. For example, I have my altitude on the default setting, and on the street of Shanghai (which is not to far from the sea) it shows that I'm 120m below sea level. I'm sure its wrong but I'm still trying to figure what made it think that Shanghai is the lowest city on earth.

B0002AZ67U_11044	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	Other reviewers covered many good aspects. Only a few things I took special notice:  What I liked:  - Very nice looking. Almost everybody takes note immediately  - Numereous functionalities. Very easy to toggle between the functions: digital display of other time zones, calendars, etc. I personally found the bezel to be useful in simple calculations. Quite amazing and once you are used to it very handy to have a calculator without buttons.  - I actually liked the weight and thickness of the watch (I bought the stainless steel version). This is definitely not a Wal-Mart feel. Never need to replace battery is great. A watch to keep.  A few things I wished Citizen would improve:  - The luminous dial/hands are too dim at night. It's impossible to see at a comfortable range in common activities, such as driving in dark. This is my biggest complaint. I had hoped this watch will be bright and shinny at night.  - The watch goes into power conservation after a certain time in darkness (say you are wearing a long sleeve). The moment it's exposed to light, the hands will move quickly to the correct time. The process is very quick but can be a little annoying at times when you need a quick glance. I wish with a full charge the watch will be smart enough not to do this but only goes into power save mode when charges are below 1/3 or so.  - Just a note, this watch cannot be laid flat on its own due to the shape of the band. Like my previous Swiss Army. I can get use to it but when I take it off at home I need to stand it in its original display box so I can get it charged under a desk lamp. Wish it could be laid flat though.

B000B2XR5W_34226	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"I was a bit worried once I've read the 1-star reviews and horror stories. I got lucky, I guess!  The box I got looked like it was in a nuclear war, or possibly even shipped by American Airlines, it was so beat up. Holes in the box made me worry there was missing parts, but not so! The battery was fully charged but the front wheel and handlebars/fender/number not installed. My son LOVES it, and it goes slow enough not to make me worry, and fast enough that it isn't wimpy. I told him to watch the ""load"" on the initial start (strong loads overheat and wear out motors and also cause biggest draw on the battery; I told him to push off with his feet before he gets going. This makes a full charge last over two hours, and he weighs well over 100 pounds at almost 12 years old).  Hint for assembly: Install the handlebars loosely, and flip the bike upside down, use cardboard or something so the rear fender doesnt scratch. Get someone (like the child) to hold the rear wheel between his knees so it won't tip over. Put the 2 bushings, axle bolt, and front wheel on (use SILVER ANTI-SEIZE, available at hardware stores or auto supply stores, its high-temp lubricant, mechanics use it on brake slide pins). Anything you can do to make it slicker will be less load on the battery and motor. The bearings in the wheel itself aren't the greatest, but looks like they could be replaced with a higher quality rating (ABEC 1?).  Install the number at the same time as the fender. In 10 minutes you'll have this together!  Make sure to tell your child to turn the switch OFF when not sitting on it: the first thing his friends wanted to do was turn the throttle, I'm glad I foresaw that, they could have been hurt. I might wire a pressure switch to the seat so it turns off with nobody riding.  Nice little LEDs ""FULL"" ""LOW"" ""RECHARGE"" indicator on handlegrip.

B000BSWEB4_40238	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"My review of this knife used to be even longer and slightly more positive. Previously this was a 5 star review now its 4 stars. Why? The knife hasn't gotten any worse, it hasn't failed me in any way, but the competition has gotten better, and my philosophy of use has changed a little. This is a long, surprisingly light knife, that chops better than you would expect from the weight. It is superbly well balanced in the hand, and the handle fills the hand well and stays grippy whether wet or dry. The D2 steel is very hard, also (contrary to some rumors) very tough), and for most people will not rust easily. The sheath that this particular version comes with is pretty good. it attaches pretty easily to a belt, is light and durable, and you can easily insert or remove the knife from either direction.  Some think it's kydex, but its not. The difference being that Kydex is less brittle in extreme cold, and may also last a bit longer. Retention is pretty good, but not great. You can turn the sheath upside down and shake the knife out of it, but you can also use the snap to prevent that. Part of the reason why I'm deducting a star is because I'm not as big a fan of the concept of a ""combat utility"" knife as I was when I bought this. Sure it's cool that  I own a piece of US military history that is also functional, but realistically what do I (I'm not a soldier) need with the ""combat"" aspect of this? Its extremely unlikely this will ever fulfill the ""combat"" half of its function in my hands, and in the last ditch emergency in which it would be used, pretty much any sturdy fixed blade knife of roughly this size would serve. I don't  need this thing balanced for a knife fight, and the tang and the swedged tip are unquestionably the weakest point of Ka-Bar's design. It is probably adequately strong, but for the price there are some other really nice options out there that make more durable designs (see Knives of Alaska, CFK, maybe even Entrek if you don't mind a few bucks more). Even if you're a soldier my criticism might still be valid. The original Ka-Bar is a brilliant design, but its purpose is to use as an every day utility knife and then eventually expect to use it in an actual knife fight (it was designed for the Pacific theater though it was certainly popular in Europe as well) even among soldiers who see combat in the 21st century, this is a design is probably the ideal only for a small minority. So the fact that there are so many other potentially great options is why I only give it 4 stars now. Its a great knife, but so are a lot of other knives. Now on to the reason why you're considering this instead of the much cheaper classic Ka-Bar the D2 steel:  First corrosion resistance: D2 is usually referred to as ""semi-stainless"" which is one of the most confusing terms I've ever heard. My initial impression seems to have been accurate though. Blade center now has a couple of short videos of corrosion tests posted on youtube, and they use D2 in one of the videos. Their demonstration pretty much validated my impressions. D2 is basically immune to plain water whether from a tap, a stream, or rain. I wouldn't store this knife (or any knife) indefinitely in a wet sheath, but other than that plain water doesn't corrode D2. However, salt water is a different matter. In the salt water test (which they did with D2 1095 carbon, and about 10 different stainless steels) everything (including H1) rusted, but in the case of everything but the D2 and 1095 the damage limited almost entirely to staining. Apparently salt water will pit D2 (though it took several hours for any rust at all to develop on the D2, and the pitting wasn't extensive). So you should be careful around salt water, blood, or food, at least to the extent of rinsing this knife off within an hour or 2 of contact with any of the above. At this point you might be wondering if coating on the helps with this at all. The answer is that the coating does help... until it wears off, and it does not take much use to wear the coating off.  Now the other performance aspects of  D2 steel: Most of what you've heard about the stuff is true. It is very hard and very wear resistant even for its hardness (ie at a particular rockwell hardness a D2 blade will generally stay sharp longer without the need to sharpen it than say a 440C blade or a 154CM blade) . That said this also makes it harder to sharpen than many steels. I can attest it is a pain to sharpen. In fact if you like to touch your knives up on an (actual metal) butcher's steel or do more extensive sharpening on a water stone or oil stone, my advice to you is not to buy this knife without changing your sharpening equipment. If you need to touch the blade up, you're going to want at least a ceramic rod, and if you need more than a light touchup, trust me, you want a diamond stone with this. Some people say D2 tends to chip and be brittle. In my experience this is not the case. I spend a week or so chopping scrap wood and plastic milk crates with this thing just to play with it and the blade never noticed. So then i decided to chop into a thin piece of hard-chromed mild steel I had lying around. My plan was to stop either when I chipped the blade or chopped the relatively thin piece of steel in half.  But since my strokes weren't very accurate, I ended up with an oddly ""jimped"" piece of steel and a fairly dull but unchipped knife blade, that was still capable of cutting cardboard, but would mostly tear paper. It took me probably an hour over the course of week to make the knife rally sharp again. So D2 was tough in my experience. If its heat treated well it is actually tougher than many steels used in knife blades.  The toughness or brittleness of a particular steel alloy is a difficult thing to measure, because  1, Its pretty rare to subject blade steels to the toughness tests (Charpy, Izod) that engineers use.  2, Even if you do find a Charpy or Izod  number for a blade steel, it might not mean much about the toughness of a knife because those tests notch the samples, and knife steels are notch sensitive (IE the knife, which has no notch won't break under the same impact as the test sample of the same steel alloy that has a notch in it)  3, Most importantly, toughness (impact resistance) for a given steel will vary based on how hard it is. You may assume that this simply means the harder the steel the more brittle, and the softer the tougher. That's not a bad general rule, but its not always true either. Every alloy that can be used in a knife has an RC number at which it will reach optimal toughness, and its not always a really low number, at least where knife blades are concerned. This is actually the secret to D2, when properly treated it retains its highest potential toughness even when it is quite hard.  4, Just to confuse you even more, there is one RC number that will produce optimal toughness in a conventionally treated blade and another (usually or maybe always higher) number that will produce optimal toughness in a cryo-treated blade. If the cryo-treatment is extensive and at really extreme temperatures, the RC hardness that produces optimal toughness may be slightly higher than on a less elaborately cryo-treated blade. (Incidentally, almost any time a knife maker brags about a super special proprietary heat treat, if there is any substance to their claims, its their cryo-proccess as this is the only part of the heat treat that the foundry they bought the steel from might know less about than the knife-maker).  Anyway with all that said, how tough is D2? It's actually tougher than most common knife steels that cost less than it does.  Tougher than 440 series steels or 420HC, tougher than AUS Series steels,5160 or 52100 ""spring steel"" tougher than plain carbon steels or 1095 Cro-Van (which is actually what most of the ""Carbon Steel"" in old line US knife company products is). I've actually seen one set of charpy numbers claiming its tougher than 154 CM as well, but I have a hard time believing that. It NOT as tough as most modern ""super-steels"" like S30V or M390. D2 is also NOT as tough as most tool steels used for industrial applications like M4,M2, A2, Crucible 3V, or even O1 (though an O1 blade left as hard as most D2 blades would be less tough than D2, the optimally toughened O1 will be softer and tougher than the optimally toughened D2). Also 440C is so close to D2 in toughness that in practice most 440C blades are probably tougher than most D2 blades because 440C is typically left softer and tougher.  Still, the edge holding for D2 is outstanding. Is it the very best? It's the best I've personally seen, but there are a lot of newer steels I don't own a knife in: S30V S35V, Elmax, and M390 (or CPM20V which is Crucible's version of M390) steels like those all probably hold an edge even longer, and are also probably even tougher to sharpen. This does seem to wear better than 154CM (though my only 154 CM blade to date is so different there's little point in comparing the 2). M2 and M4 will also outperform D2 (albeit they sacrifice pretty much all corrosion resistance so I would not personally use them outdoors though there are people who know more than me who do this), and in a really heavy chopping blade, I'd imagine Crucible 3V (which should be less wear resistant but MUCH tougher)  is a better bet.  Finally, it should be noted that all of the above info on steel types assumes they are ALL heat treated optimally or nearly optimally. While there is no super-special secret heat treat process that will allow 420HC or 1050 carbon steel to equal D2, let alone S30V or 3V, it is possible to screw up any alloy with a BAD heat treat. Just like there's probably no baking process that would make Wonder Bread taste like a bread made with semolina flour and the best sour dough starter in San Francisco, but you can still ruin a semolina sour dough loaf and make it taste worse than Wonder Bread by burning it. Oh, and generally, fancier, more expensive steels require more elaborate heat treat processes that are easier to screw up than simpler, cheaper steels. In fact most of the cost of a fancy steel knife is the heat treat and machining rather than the cost of the raw material. D2 is especially difficult to heat treat moreso than 154CM, though most of the remaining classic American companies like Ka-Bar, Ontario, and Case, and Queen are a lot better at it than they are at heat treating D2 than say 154 CM because they've been using it for decades and decades.  And this is the reason why Ka-Bar's D2 extreme is an excellent knife. Ka-Bar has been using D2 steel in knife blades for a very long time. They heat treat the steel in the same factory where they make the knives, they Rockwell test their own knives, and at least at the time I bought mine, their website also indicated that they cryo-treated their own knives. This is a 59-60RC blade vs the classic Ka-Bar which is 56-58, not as tough, not resistant to corrosion, and with handle that can also have problems if exposed to water. This obviously has a much different guard (which I actually prefer) and a slightly different shaped butt cap. While some people have managed to break the tang (and more rarely) the tip off of the classic Ka-Bar, I can find very few  instances of anyone breaking anything but the butt cap on this knife. That's usually attributed to ""brittle D2"" but the butt caps of all Ka-Bars including this one are made of 1095 high carbon steel.  So bottom line, if you want a highly functional piece of military history, buy one of these. Even though D2 is a difficult steel to heat treat, it is a great steel in the right hands. While Ka-Bar may not be Bob Dozier or Paul Bos, they do definitely know how to handle D2. If you just want the best outdoor survival knife possible at the best price, this is still pretty good, but its definitely got some stiff competition. And if you want a similar style for less money, the Cold Steel Leatherneck is an excellent bet (Better than the traditional KA Bar imo because it has a thicker tang, a thicker tip and is made from a 4116 steel which is a stainless steel roughly equal to 420hc if you look at the formula. Cold Steel also actually makes the Leatherneck in D2 for around $70, but that's made in China. Don't get me wrong, Chinese factories CAN make good knife blades sometimes, but I've never heard of a Chinese knife in D2 steel before 2016, and like I said its a difficult steel to heat treat, so unless you feel like paying $70 to be one of Cold Steel's Beta Testers, I'd still pony up for a Ka-Bar made in Olean NY for at least the next couple years if you want a knife like this in D2."	Is it the very best?

B0007W1MYE_21002	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	This gun (seen under a bunch of different names here at Amazon, if they look alike, chances are they're all the Double Eagle M83) really impressed me the day it came (only 4 business days to ship from LA to PA).  While I was waiting for the battery to charge, I toyed around with the gun.  The sight that comes standard on the gun is pretty handy, but it's almost required to remove the handle part of the sight nearest the trigger to but the electric sight on.  Even then, it's more of a showy accesory than anything because you have to aim higher than the crosshair shows.  The flashlight is a nice addition to everything as well.  You have to be careful when putting on the strap because my friend, who bought the same gun, put his on and the strap came off, resulting in the gun falling to the ground, the barrel hitting first, and the mock silencer broke off.  My strap hasn't failed me yet, just like every other part of the gun.  So now to the fun.  If you plan on using this gun during wars/capture the flag/etc., I strongly suggest you buy an extra magazine and speed loader and practice reloading.  The gun is accurate up to about 30 feet until it starts to curve a little, unless you use the useful hop up system.  By switching the lever from 'normal' to 'hop up' mode, your gun puts more of a backspin on the BBs, making them curve upwards and get more distance.  This is great for shooting people high up that are far away once you get the aiming down.  The automatic function is a lot of fun and great for taking out lots of people during gameplay.  The magazine runs out fast though, so use it sparingly.  I measured the FPS to range between 220-260, depending on battery power, type of BBs (.12 gram giving the highest FPS), and wind.  I've used it for 2 battles so far, both of which were about 4 hours long.  The battery didn't even show signs of slowing down, so just keep it charged and you'll be fine.  I highly recommend this gun to anyone looking to impress and have hours upon hours of fun with friends.  PROS: -6 setting adjustable shoulder stock easily caters to your shooting style.    -High battery life keeps you in the game all day long.    -Gun hasn't jammed once in over 8 hours of use.    -Hop up system is great for that extra distance.    -Looks pretty sweet.    -Accessories (Flashlight, Electronic Sight, Extra Barrel) are a fun addition the gun.    -Powerful, but not too powerful for children of all ages.    -Realistic look and weight gives you the feel of an actual M16.  -------------------------------------------  CONS: -Only accurate up to about 30 feet until BBs begin to curve.    -Plastic screw-on barrel has a chance of breaking if dropped on barrel.    -Sight can be complicated until you get used to the gun.    -Reloading can be annoying, but not a problem if you practice.

B000DLB8RU_44535	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	These are by far, the best boots out there. Way better than the steel or aluminum types. They fit the exact size and taper of your ankle.. something that the other boots cannot do. They are not easy to put on but when something fits tight, it does take longer to put on or to take it off.  These are the latest generation of boots, not the same old design from the 1980s but they can be a bit uncomfortable. You just have to get used to them. I could only use this boots for 2 mins at a time and now (3 weeks later) I can hang for 5 mins. As time passes on, maybe I'll be able to use them for longer periods of time.  Also, this boots will eliminate your lower back pain but not sure how effective it is for neck pain. I feel that I need stronger traction in that area and inversion alone is not enough. Only time can tell.  One final thought: Doing sit ups while hanging down is not necesarily better than doing sit ups on the floor ... it's dificult to exercise for long periods of time on gravity boots (maybe 5 mins) ... your ankles will hurt.  When I do sit ups on the floor, I can exercise for as long as I want and I can do far more sit ups. Also, I use ankle weights :-) and move my legs while doing the sit ups.

B0006FLBSO_15662	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"With a weight-training background I already have a number of products focusing upon forearm and grip strength. This by appearance and description seemed to fit a very specific purpose, what could be called finger-tip strength, so I went ahead and gave it a try.  Receiving it, the high-quality construction was immediately noticeable. Beginning with the highest tension [black] gripper, I began use intermittently, whenever web pages loaded in slowly, between television commercials, and so on.  I had no idea why during my twice-a-month hobbyist guitar playing, I was able to play with a marked increase in speed and accuracy. The fingers occasionally seemed to be pulled onto the fretboard like magnets. Thinking about it for a few minutes, I realized this device was the only significant change I had made over that time. Typically I had to warm-up for at least 30 to 45 minutes before my hands correctly played quicker fingering patterns. There was no lag time this time.  For the price and diminutive size of this device, it is surprising how effective it is at its focused purpose. I also noticed that, while my typing has not gotten any faster, I can type somewhat longer without becoming self-aware of fatigue.  --------  There are several reviews for this gripping device that claim insufficient resistance, even with the highest tension [black] version. This may be due to a misconception of the purpose and usage of this particular device. It is what could be thought of as a finger-grip strengthener, as opposed to those devices which develop palm grip-strength, which are far more common and found at any sporting goods store.  The tell-tale sign of improper use, is through where you position your grip when performing the exercises. If you find yourself grasping at mid-finger level, between the first and second knuckles, and squeezing all of the fingers together at the same time, pumping over and over again, you are using this improperly. You are to place the very tips of the fingers, before the first knuckles, on the finger-rests, and proceed to provide force with individual fingers, alternating with other patterns such as all four-fingers simultaneously as well, but always with this positioning. If you try using this device as a mid-finger, mid-grip strengthener (with the device ending up resting against the palm of the hand), you are using it incorrectly.  For a mid-grip strengthener, Captains Of Crush is very highly recommended. These provide massive amounts of resistance, and are for the more typical mid-grip strengthening exercises. Even the trainer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captains-of-Crush-Trainer-Gripper/dp/B0002U3CNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captains of Crush Trainer Gripper</a>, will at the beginning be highly difficult for most athletes. The efforts are well worth it, however, these are extremely high-quality devices. There is actually official certification for doing their highest level grip one single time, for one single repetition (the two ends touching). Through these you can perform the more typical palm-strength exercises.  Both the C.O.C. type of palm-level strengthener, and this Gripmaster fingertip-level type of strengthener, are needed for more complete and balanced grip strength. Doing exercises focusing on the forearms directly can also be very important. Any grip exercises strengthen the forearms as well, but only indirectly. It depends on how important overall lower-arm strength is to you. In any case, the Gripmaster is for working the most distal part of the grip, that is the tips of the fingers. Working it any other way, is not using the device for what it was designed for."

B000AB6DCS_32752	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"I will not repeat too much what has been covered before, but I will point out the following:  It attachs quite nicely to the existing braz-ons on bikes like mine that have a single tube running down from the seat post to the rear wheel that opens up just before the brakes without using the adaptor that comes with the basket.  I did not use any of the hardware that came with it.  I did post photos.  For the past 30 years, I have been using saddle bags/panniers, however they can be cumbersome if you just want to pop over to the local store to get something and take time to remove and reattach every single day and tend to hit the wheel when I accellerate, so I was ready to try something new.  My biggest issue with panniers was alternating between taking the train and biking required me to transfer stuff between my backpack and my pannier and needing to know pretty early on which route I was taking in order to pack the correct bag.  With this basket, I just have 1 backpack with my non-biking gear in it and I can decide at the last second whether I am taking the train or bike without worrying that I am forgetting something. I have been using it nearly daily for over a year now with no regrets or any wish to go back to panniers.  My former every-day backpack is too big to fit in the 7.5""/5"" width. I had a tall and thin hiking backpack (no front pocket) that is working perfectly.  For my biking stuff, for the other basket, I bought a new laptop case (Targus Checkpoint-Friendly Mobile Elite Roller for 15.4 Inch Laptops TBT045US (Black)) which exactly fits one basket. However the nylon is shredding prematurely (not so with my equally tight fitting NorthFace backpack).  Each basket is 18 x 7.5 at the top and 16 x 5 at the bottom and 11"" tall  The entire width is 20.5"" (meaning the rack itself is 5.5"" wide)  The entire length from the attachment bolt to rear most point is 24""  The reason for the 1 star off is that the clearance on my bike (a 20 year old 26"" Schwin MOAB) is only 7 inches from the pedal spindle to the basket. I wear 11.5 shoes and I can no longer ride with the ball of my foot directly over the pedal spindle. I have to pedal with my foot forward about 1 to 2 inches. I have become accustomed to this and I have been unable to find (either logically or via research) what the real downside is to this position. In fact some advocate for this position. But it is an adjustment for me as I have been riding with the ""ball directly over the spindle"" technique for 30 years now.  I would have preferred that they made the connection bars longer as there are probably more people who want the rack further away from their feet and do not care how far past the rear wheel the rack goes. My rear wheel sticks out a good 2 inches past the rear most part of the basket.  One downside to this rack is that I now have a tendancy to overpack and my ride can get a bit unstable with too much weight in back. I have to remember to keep the weight down. I was just now considering a trailer, but there are a host of other issues to be dealt with there that I am better off with this basket.  Update: I have had this for 1.5 seasons now and I have no regrets.  It was a very good purchase and is easier to deal with on a daily basis than panniers were."

B0009PUS6M_27417	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"I have some nephews starting into boy scouts and was interested in a stove they might like.  I liked the idea of one like this versus ones that sit on disposable tanks since it looks more stable (as well as being able to connect it to a bulk tank if wanted with a hose).  Looking at the online pictures I liked the way this one looked with round bars for the pot support (versus bent sheet metal supports in similar ones) and thought ""That looks better if someone did try to carry such in a back-pack since it won't have knife-blade like edges easily ripping into things"".  So I ordered one up even with seeing some reviews of ""This is bigger than I expected"" thinking it may be ~8-10 inches across versus ~6-8 (and not seeing anyone giving dims on it).  The truth is that the main body is 12 inch diameter at the base, it is almost 14 inches across at the feet (the widest points) and the pot support bars will hold an 11 inch diameter pot with it sitting flat on the horizontal parts of the bars.  So maybe that tells you more about how ""Big"" it really is versus pictures of it alone (that are hard to scale with no comparisons).  This also explains to me why it goes for over $30 versus many single burner stoves going for $15-20 (that I wondered about too before ordering it). I'll keep it since having this may be as good or better than many 2 burner stoves (where putting a 11 inch pan on them ends up with almost 1/2 the pan hanging off the edges), but I hope this helps minimize surprises for others of you considering this."

B000ELYXOO_49006	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I have been buying these for close to 7 years now. What drew me to them at first was the great price, but also the fact that they're green, which is my favorite color. I was looking for something with a little personality rather than the normal colors of tan or black. Plus, the dark color is very figure-flattering.  Even in the hottest parts of summer I stay quite comfortable. I usually ride about 1 hour, and it used to be that I would get quite hot. These are very thin and breathable, and very comfy.  The only downside is that after about 2-3 summers of using them, they usually get a hole on the inside of the knee at the contact point of the saddle, due to their thinness. But because the price is so low I don't mind buying them every 3 years or so.  All in all, these are a great choice if you're on a tight budget but you love to ride in the heat.

B0009R96YK_28641	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"First, I had used these for decades. If the bike falls on the left side, any mirror is likely to break but I would always replace a broken mirror with this model.  There is a thin brass threaded barrel inside the base. That threaded barrel is there to accept the screw. Twice now, on two different mirrors purchased a week apart, that threaded barrel has come out of the base. In theory it could be glued back into the base but the barrel is so thin that it breaks at the slightest pressure of a pliers needed to get the barrel off of the screw, so that it might be glued back into the base. It really should be glued at the factory but recently it seems it is not.  By the way, the manufacturer sells replacement parts but asks $4 to ship what could be shipped for the price of two postal stamps. In my case it would cost $10 yet you can buy the entire mirror for $12 so what's the point of offering parts?  Update: I grew tired of replacing plastic mirrors every time the bike falls on the side with the mirror so I opted to get a metal motorcycle mirror here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UNIVERSAL-BAR-END-HANDLEBAR-MOUNT-MIRROR-BLACK-6212041/dp/B005DSPO82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UNIVERSAL BAR END HANDLEBAR MOUNT MIRROR BLACK 6212041</a>.

B000667LV4_14541	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"I just bought this seat today and installed it; I can't speak for the longevity of it, and I have to admit that after reading the reviews I'm a little wary of the gel pads potentially falling off.  Oh well, we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.  As of the moment, this is a great seat - a a huge improvement over the old bicycle seat that came with my used bike.  My mountain bike's old seat was much longer and narrower and far more hard - it was seriously uncomfortable after a day of moderate riding.  In fact, I realized that I needed a new bike seat when I hopped on it this morning and felt pain arrow through my crotch and backside.  Ow.  So I went out and bought this bicycle seat as it seemed the most reasonably priced one on the rack that would do what I want.  And indeed that it does - this bicycle seat is much wider than most standard seats.  You'll notice that when you install it you'll sit in a more ""upright"" position, even on a mountain bike.  This really isn't a seat for those who are looking to do serious off-roading in my opinion, and it probably would look strange on road bikes or mountain bikes that are not obviously calibrated to be commuters.  However, I find that the upright position is more comfortable for city riding and it takes a lot of pressure off of my back and wrists since I'm not as hunched over, and I'm not trying to shift weight away from my rear as much.  I suppose it's worth mentioning that I'm a size 14 US women's; my trunk's got some junk in it.  If you're the same way, this is an excellent bicycle seat for you.  I think a lot of people are having problems with this bike seat due to the way they are installing it.  Or at least, the first time I put this on my bike, I also thought the horn was sticking way too far up.  I solved this by positioning the seat itself a little farther back on the post than the previous seat had been, and this solved the problem.  Another adjustment you'll probably have to make is the height of the seat - I definitely dropped the seat post about an inch or two after installing this, since it's thicker than a typical bike seat.  Once it was on, though, it was entirely comfortable, and I was able to go for a 13 mile jaunt today with little problem - and I'm a novice cyclist. (Well, little problem other than the exhaustion that hit after mile 12, haha.)  Suffice to say that my butt ain't sore, or at least not nearly as sore as my legs.  We'll have to say how well the seat holds up, though; I figure that if either the gel pads fall out or it ends up being way too absorbant of rain (I live in Portland, OR; rain is an issue), I'll probably end up wrapping it in duct tape or something.  The seat itself is perfectly serviceable and at a very good price, provided that you take the time to install it correctly."

The other brands have better pictures so if you want a better look at the Schwinn check out the other clones.

The resistance adjustment is a little hard to figure out and should be labeled better. Finally a heavier flywheel would be a welcome addition. (minus one more star)  Other than the above mentioned complaints this is a nice enough magnetic unit. It is easy to assemble (like another reviewer I found it easier to screw the ""L"" bolt in first) and comes with a replacement skewer so you don't need to worry about the fit of your existing road skewer. The Schwinn trainer actually worked fine even on a bike with a solid rear axle with hex nuts (the nuts happen to be exactly the right size).  One of the reviewers of the Graber mentioned that the resistance setting didn't do anything but this is not true. Twisting the resistance knob clockwise moves the resistance shaft farther away from the spinning wheel in 4 progressive steps. Each step makes for less resistance as the resistance shaft gets farther away until you have gone all the way around. Once you have gone all the way around the last step returns the shaft to the closest position (greatest resistance). There are a total of 5 possible settings (closest plus 4 additional steps) but they are completely unmarked so it is easy to see how this would be confusing. There is a noticeable difference in resistance between the closest setting and the 2nd closest setting.  Verdict: Decent but far from perfect."

I mastered riding it in about a week. The only two brands worth buying are razor and micro. But in my opinion, razor is the sure-fire best. It is the lightest in the scooter industry along with micro. The reason I like razor better is because micro make the foot-board to long so you can't go down slopes to well. But I think micro would be the best for adults because their feet probibly not fit on a razor. I don't fall to often so you don't need to woory about you or your child falling. The only time I fell really bad was when I was doing a trick where I do a wheelie in the air. I leaned back to far and my scooter slid aproxamately 10 feet and I slid 3.

B000BT1GAI_40159	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	Despite mixed reviews and less of a discount than what you can find on most other Spyderco knives--such as best sellers like Endura4 and Salt Series (there's probably a reason for that, namely collectors/demand)I took a chance. I've always liked Centofante designed knives and this one delivers. It has very good quality steel that arrived extremely sharp. It's almost cliche, but yes, it easily shaved hair off my arm. It arrived much sharper than the Spyderco Native did, which besides not arriving as sharp, seems over rated compared to this less expensive (and foreign made) knife.  Unlike the Native, which loses a half inch of it's already shorter blade to it's choil, I like how the Centofante's blade edge is almost continuous from handle to tip and has an effective choil that won't abrade my pants pockets. The blade locks up very tight--you have to really pull on it hard to get a wee bit of wiggle and that occurs only if I'm not holding the handle real tight (don't try that at home, kids) and as a result, the liner lock in the very light weight handle is allowed to flex. That's not likely to happen in 'real world' usage and I think it's an inevitable trade off, due to the knife's light weight. Plus it's more a case of me, pushing it (not abusing) it to see what it's limits might be. Having a steel liner w/o excessive added weight is another plus.  So this is a very light weight, pocket friendly knife that has more style than most Spydercos (that's not saying much) but still with all the utility you expect from Spyderco. No it's not screw down construction--it's pinned, but at this price point, that's not unusual and I have a pretty good sense that it'll last a good while. Lots of 'bang for the buck'.  No, as said before this review, the handle's not the grippiest, but it's more than ample and safe--it has it's own stylish flair too. I could see that if you're really rough, the snazzy 'Syder' inlay could conceivably come out, but just remember these two words 'crazy glue'! Again unlikely under normal use, but Spyderco has great service and if it came out and you lost it, Spyderco would most certainly send you a replacement--they're great that way.  I have a lot of knives, including folders that cost many more times than this one, but I'd have no qualms about carrying this everyday. The blade/edge position in relation to the handle (ergonomics) is very good and holding it in traditional style, it's great for just about any medium strength task--meat, fruit, whittling, I'd even cut roses or saplings--heck it's VG10--a strong steel. I don't expect to get into a knife fight and I'd never bring even this knife to a GUN fight, but nonetheless, you can very quickly, with one hand, change position to 'fighting' and with over 3 inches of edge and the blade already canted forward (outward) a bit, keep most predators well beyond arm's length. It opens fairly quickly, not as fast as the more expensive Spydercos' with bronze phosphor washers, but it's still smooth and fairly fast out of the box--with time, it'll just get faster.  The knife looks nice --'classy'--enough that when you cut a price tag off after buying something at the register, the clerk probably won't scream 'POLICE!  Anyway, to make a long review longer and risk alienating my wife (lol), the Centofante III offers a great combination of ergonomics, construction quality, style, utility and the VG10 steel is pretty darn good quality stuff--it' been around a while, resists corrosion well, stays pretty and you don't have a 'baby'it. It holds an fine edge well and doesn't require high tech tools or an hour to restore a keen edge--not that it will get dull on you quickly. I also like how when I'm around guys who know knives, they're surprised that this pretty,  'stylin' knife is actually a Spyderco--typically the ugly ducklings of the 'better knives' family!  Now I have to stop thinking about buying another one, before all the collectors buy them, only to store them in their boxes and wait for them to appreciate!

Great idea, but really needs more thought. Because I would have hated to have had this out on the road and have to clean this  up before I put it back in my car.

B0008G2V6M_22197	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I got my Favorit about 5 days after I ordered it and when I went to put it together I realized that a piece was missing (the bar to hold the foot pedals on).  So I called customer service and they sent me one free of charge the next day.  I was a little disappointed because I was excited to use it but couldn't without something to put my feet on.  So I waited another 5 or so days and I got that part.  After using it I realized the right shock absorber wasn't working correctly, and it started losing more pressure within a few day to where it was unusable.  I emailed customer service this time and they sent me a new shock right away.  Since then I haven't had any problems, the machine works great and I've been using it about 3 weeks daily with the new shock.  The customer service was really great, which is why I decided not to take off a star.  I think I might have gotten a returned machine.  It was obviously a dud either way, everything else about the experience was so high quality it's hard to believe this sort of thing would happen regularly.  I wanted to respond to the other review about the resistance adjustment too (because I was worried about this when I was reading them).  When I was talking to the customer service lady on the phone the first time, I told her that I had gotten two of the wrong bolts.  There are a set of bolts for putting the arms on with tooth that goes all the way up the bolt (this is also used for the resistance knobs), and another set for the arms that only has tooth about a third of the way up.  I hadn't gotten any of the second type, but I had two extra of the first type.  She said that they replaced those because people were accidentally using the the bolts without the full tooth on the resistance adjustment, which wouldn't work because you can't screw it down all the way.  So the people who were complaining about the resistance just didn't follow the instructions.  Also, people seemed to make a big deal out of the instructions but they're very clear with good pictures, diagrams of the bolts you need to use, etc.  Seems to me they must never have had to partially assemble anything.  All you have to do was bolt the arms, legs, and foot pedals on.  It's mostly assembled when you get it.  Be careful to put the arms on the correct way, though, the bend should face forward like in the picture.  Overall I'm very glad I bought this machine.  I read a lot of reviews on a lot of the cheaper ($100 - $200) piston rowing machines and they were all complaining about their machines degrading within a week of two of getting it, like broken wheels on the seats and shocks leaking oil and loud squeaks and that's why I decided to pay a bit more.  The Favorit is really quiet, and obviously build to last.  The resistance is good too, at its lowest setting it's pretty easy, so you can do an aerobic workout, and on it's highest setting I can hardly pull it back.  I have it set around the middle right now so it's like a weight machine.  You can even sit on it backwards and do a bench press.  And if you have problems with it, you'll have a really great support center to work with.

B000C0SRI0_42272	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	"My kukri did not arrive sharp enough to shave with. After reading reviews about how well it kept its edge, I wanted to start with the sharpest edge possible.  I used a ceramic v sharpener, not shaving with that edge, then I used an oil stone, same thing.  Finally I used an E.Z.-lap, those of you who know this product know it shines most when handling pocket knives.  By holding my hand on the back of the heavy blade in the area I was focusing on, moving as necessary, I was able to keep it flush and get a razors edge.  As a ""work horse"", I'd say it beats the cold steal in efficiency, you can cut through much thicker brush, much faster with much less energy.  This is a great blade for the price...but not as a machete at this price.  I can only speak from my experience but after only five minutes of heavy cutting, I notice a substantial decrease in what each swing can do and after half an hour you will want to stop and sharpen it for a minute or so.  For defense, when you have the edge finely honed, oiled, etc.  Well, in the case of a violent home invasion you could just chop someone in half with it.

There are signs of were but they are cosmetic and there is no fraying, unraveling, or any other process by which I can see the scabbard beginning to journey towards losing it's functional integrity.  The material is not fancy or what I would call high quality, but it does the job,  To get a Kukri of this quality with a blade tempered so well(looking at every review, I'd say there is fantastic Q.C. were the blade is concerned) at his price, would be a bargain if it came with no sheath.  But I think the one it comes with does the job and even if it didn't, I'd never deduct a star, I'd just buy a better sheath.  Even If end up having to spend 20 dollars on another sheath, I'd still say this is a good buy."

B00076ZDLI_18335	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	I scanned the Amazon page for this product for a good 20 minutes before submitting my order. I saw that there were three sizes for these gloves and I wanted to be sure I got the right size. Unfortunately the vendor didn't provide any sizing charts so I had to read multiple reviews and take a guess at the best size. I decided to go for 14 oz. being a 6' 180 pound man. I received the gloves and although they were good quality, they were way too small. I immediately noticed that on the side of the Everlast package was a simple sizing chart, that would have suggested that I buy the 16 oz gloves. Great to see this information after the fact! Maybe the vendor should consider adding that sizing chart to the product page? Sounds too easy.  After receiving the gloves that were too small, I contacted the vendor about an exchange due to size. Unfortunately for me, the vendor said that they were unable to process any exchanges at the time and my only option would be to return the item and get refunded. Great. I will do that! Unfortunately again, per their return policy, I needed to pay for return postage (including insurance at their request). I was also charged a 10% restocking fee! All in all, it totaled 15 dollars and I got nothing to show for it.  Go to your nearest sporting goods store and just buy your gloves in person. Not worth the hassle online.

B000ENORRA_50018	Reviews_Sports_and_Outdoors	Excellent. I've tried at least 3 pairs of swim gloves and they never fit right. These cover my hand completely, and importantly, my wrist too. I've recently torn some ligament in my left wrist and these gloves help keep it stable. But even without the wrist issue, these are the best fitting gloves I've even bought. They hug my hand and fingers all around, leave the tips of my fingers free so I can adjust my goggles or pick up my water bottle; they give the right amount of resistance, and help push the water efficiently, unlike when I try to hold my fingers together -- never as good as a glove. I can also pull them on without the tremendous difficulty I found with other gloves, even when the other gloves are then a sloppy fit! I'm very happy with them!

It IS for days when it's already raining...or you know it's gonna be raining...or your trip weather report is saying lots of rain.  This hat has been with me about 8 yrs I'd guess.  BWCA, out west, down south to the gulf, I've enjoyed it.  It's TOTALLY waterproof. I got the Java/coffee brown version and my wife doesn't even mind it too much, haha.  For some reason, I didn't grab it on my latest trip.  I had a waxed cotton ball cap and my hood on my rain gear...it was ok...but I did find I missed the full coverage that this hat provides.  To stay dry, I had to use the hood too.  I lost a lot of vision and was always fighting the hood on this trip.  Not exactly what you want when you are running a river you thought was calm...but rain blows it out unexpectedly.  I can't say I'll never go without it again - but I can say I'll probably never leave it behind if there's much chance of rain on my trip again.  oh - I will say this - make sure you use this hat with a rainjacket that either has no hood or your hood packs away into the collar like mine.  The OR hat WILL drop all the rain right off the back.  Having a hood ""out"" would just fill up with water in no time."

The handles at the ends are able to rotate, which could be good or bad, depending on whether you want to workout your wrist, but I like it because it is appropriate for resistance bands. It comes with the bag as shown, so you are able to conveniently store it or carry it around. I haven't used the ankle strap much, but it is secure. I like doing bicep lifts with these, and I notice the results more quickly than using traditional weights. However, it won't help with lifting weights, as weights require you to use your wrist as well, which you don't get much wrist workout with these. I use them in addition to lifting weights.

B0002C9EP8_37829	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Hands down the best cat collar I've found to date!  My cat and I came to a resolve when she insisted on being an outdoor cat... a collar. I was using various basic collars until I noticed that she was losing fur around her neck. Other times I found crust (as if she scratched it or it rubbed her to rough).  Since I spoil her with everything I figured it was time to find the best collar too. Checked [...] and other places and everyone seemed to have collars with hip designs but nothing really to help the irritation if wearing a collar 24/7.  This is the collar I have been looking for. It is light and durable. It doesn't tightly wrap around her neck but loops around with the id tag sitting loosely on her chest. It has the breakaway feature so my little huntress doesn't get caught in anything while on the run. I bought 3 more. The Red with blue white speckle is adorable. :)  Her fur is growing back and she is at her happiest... and I have one less thing to worry about :)  P.S.: There have been complaints on other reviews about the collar not 'breaking away' - they fixed that some time ago so it snaps off easily.	:)  Her fur is growing back and she is at her happiest...	46:54	926:934	BLUE EYES - ADJUSTABLE BREAKAWAY CAT SAFETY COLLAR - BIKINI MODEL		happiest		"BE_AT(e, THEME=my cat, ATTRIBUTE=""happiest"")"	BE_AT(e, THEME=my cat, ATTRIBUTE=happy)	#2=ATTRIBUTE	extent	positive	y

My Labrador, Gus, was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia when he was 4 and not expected to have quality of life beyond 7 years of age. With daily Connectin, not only did Gus live until age 13, he experienced a high quality of life.  Only at the end did he develop mild arthritis.  I attribute this to daily use of Connectin, throughout most of his life.  It has a flavor that all of my dogs have enjoyed.  Most recently I adopted an 8 yo Springer Spaniel from a local rescue.  He was taking Rimadyl, an NSAID, that is mostly for pain relief and requires monthly blood tests to check for liver damage.  I switched Hershey over to Connectin and he is doing great!

B0002DHOB8_41934	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	My old heater that came with the tank was looking bad, covered with calcium from our Texas hardwater. I found this heater at a local pet store for about $20. It was one of the least expensive ones I had found. Now I think I know why. I swapped the heaters out and it seemed to be working fine. A couple of days after installing it, it kept the temp where I usually have it, around 80 degrees. Another couple of days pass and I notice the temp had dropped down to about 78. I figured maybe the heater ran a little cooler than what you set it at, so I bumped it up to about 82. The light NEVER went off and the temp NEVER went back up. I cranked it up to 86 and got the same results. This POS heater stopped heating after barely a week!? If the store doesn't take it back, according to the heater packaging I have to pay to ship it to them PLUS pay another $4 on top of that. Suddenly the $20 heater could wind up costing $30. Seems I should have just paid a little more for ANOTHER brand in the first place. Stay away from these CHEAP aquarium heaters.

Shelby is our 55lb power chewing black lab and the KONGs are the only chew toys or treat holder that she has not destroyed in most a horrific and eviscerating manner.  We have purchased the red KONG and the black KONG in the large size  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KONG-Extreme-Large/dp/B0002AR0II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KONG Extreme Large</a>&nbsp;); the red one was fine until she reached full size then the black one had to be purchased because the black KONG's rubber is a bit stronger and more dense.  We generally will buy these KONG treats and give our dog one inside a KONG every day or two.  Initially a KONG stuffed with one of these treats would occupy about an hour's worth of chew time, which was especially good while puppy training since it was the KONG being chewed and not my shoes or furniture legs.  She has since gotten very adept at getting the KONG treat out by vice-gripping the entire KONG with her powerful jaws and crushing the treat within so the pieces can fall out of the bottom hole.  It now takes ol' Shel about ten minutes to get the treat out but she still enjoys them immensely.  These treats have decent ingredients and do not make a mess.  One caveat, the peanut butter ones can be an allergy issue for family members and visitors because they will get carried around the house by the dog...we stick with the liver ones and bacon ones for that reason. I attached a picture of Shelby going to town on a large sized KONG Extreme stuffed with a KONG treat for size reference.  Good luck."

B0002C7FHM_37850	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	We got this for our American Bulldog mix puppy.  He's a real sweetie, but he's taken a liking to running off our property (about an acre of thick woods) when not on leash (or barking incessantly when we tie him up in the yard while we do yard work), or being a bit too aggressive with our 4 year old lab mix.  The biggest issue I have with this product is the delay that occurs.  When I press either button, it will sometimes take several seconds to work - this results in confusing the puppy because he is sometimes not doing the unwanted behavior anymore.  I've also had the shock button stick a few times (sorry puppy!!!).  ALSO, ALSO - I would give this maybe 10-20 foot range outdoors.  Sometimes it just doesn't work at all - not sure if it's battery related (they're brand new batteries!!) or interference with other wireless devices in the house, or the fact that we're surrounded by high mountains ... ?  who knows.  It works inside quite well (when it does work), I use only the tone 95% of the time, and then I follow up with a shock if he continues the unwanted behavior.  Outside is a different story.  If I try the 'come' command and then use the tone when he ignores me, and then follow up with the shock if he ignores the tone, he just continues running off.  Like he's running away from the collar/remote.  Perhaps with more training on a long lead, this issue will be resolved.  Based on the other reviews I read I REALLLLLLLYYYY wanted this to work - but for now I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars.  I don't regret getting it (especially for indoor training), but for outdoor issues, it's not that great.  Lower the price and I would raise it to 4 stars.

B0002D31QU_40050	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	We rescued a jack russell mix last summer. He is very sweet and affectionate except he has the loudest, sharpest bark I have every heard in my life! You literally jump out of your skin when he barks. He's not bad in the house, but when in the yard, he is so excited about the leaves and critters that his barking was really becoming a problem.

B0002CH1BW_39725	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I've raised several puppies and am always worried by the little ones missing their siblings during the first days. This little toy is incredible in relieving the stress on the new puppy.  My latest little girl simply loves the snuggle toy. Very little crying and whining. When I go to her crate she is usually nestled with her head resting on the snuggle toy. The heartbeat does the trick and the soft cuddly feel are the keys. The batteries last for about a week which is very efficient in my opinion. If you are getting a new puppy this is well worth the money and it has to be one of the best concepts to reduce separation anxiety that I have found.

B0002DK26C_51346	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	A smart dog is a boon unless he has insufficient entertainment. In which case, he will find his own entertainment and it may involve the evisceration of a decorative pillow and the defecating of polyfill a day or two later. This Tricky treat ball, on the other hand, is fun for everyone. There is one tube opening into the ball's hollow center you can fill with small food or treats. It only doles out kibble when rolled just right. The more kibble inside, the more will fall out but it becomes more challenging as it empties and my teacup mastiff Anchovy, loves to work out every last bite on his own. He will also go and find it when I'm busy and boring. I laugh aloud to see him trot off and return with the orange ball in mouth, drop it and nose it around the room, gobbling up whatever he manages to roll out of it. He paws and bats it, too.  It's a simple but challenging toy that rewards a dog for playing with it and that's earned Anchovy's highest rating, four out of four paws.

B0001AB42W_10011	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	After floor time was over, our 12 week old Siamese had been trying to play with our guinea pigs without us.  She would simply not stay away from their cage.  Even after adding a lid to the cage, and covering it with pillows, she wouldn't stop.  We removed the pillows and covers, added this Scat Mat at the LOWEST setting, and she only tried it once after that.  She hopped up, got startled, and has left them alone ever since.  Although she was startled she continued playing immediately... only with her toys and not the piggies.  NOTE: Before using the Scat Mat, our entire family tested it in bare feet on all settings.  The lowest setting feels like a creepy tingling sensation.  The highest setting feels more like a quick shock from static electricity.  None of them hurt.  We have not needed to go past the lowest setting and our kitten only needed to touch it once.

B0001ZWZ8O_11152	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	We have a very large German Shepherd puppy. He was always jumping our back yard fence and getting into places he shouldn't. After running after him, we finally decided we needed to get aggressive. We bought this as a means to and end. Di it deliver? yes and no. Overall it has done a great job. It did not take long for our dog to learn the parameter of where he could and could not go. The problem I found though, is that he became accustomed to the charge on its highest setting. If he wants to run bad enough, hell charge and take it. The collar has an auto safety shut off after 30 seconds. My dog will rough it out in order to win his freedom the device.  This may be unique with my animal, but it at times will fail to stop him. Most of the time however, it does serve as a good deterrent and keeps him within the perimeter of where I want him to be.

B0002DJ82G_46472	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	So far, so good with this aquarium filter! This is the third different type of filter that I have tried for my aquarium. The other two brands that I purchased first broke within a short amount of time. I was understandably skeptical about this one being any different.  However, this Penn Plax Cascade Hang-On Aquarium really gets the job done! It's the quietest filter that I've tried so far. The sound is actually pretty relaxing. Instead of a horribly loud, electronic humming noise, this one sounds like a gentle waterfall.  My fish tank was noticeably brighter and more clear within the first 30 minutes or so after it was installed and turned on. By the next morning, the aquarium was crystal clear. It also has an adjustable flow setting that's proven to be useful. Not only does it help to create plenty of aeration, but it can be set to a lower volume during feeding times or other times when you wouldn't want as strong of a flow of water rippling throughout your tank.

B000241NRI_12458	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Original - Great value.  I went for the cheapest, well rated automatic feeder after reading various reviews for all the different types of feeders at different price points.  It seemed like all of them had at least some reviews where the owners' dogs/cats figured out how to break into them.  My 20 pound terrier hasn't been able to get into it.  She'll push it around sometimes, but seems to understand that she can't break in.  Can't set the time precisely, but you can get close enough.  At the price point, you can't complain.  Saves me from having to get up at 5am and worry about working late. Update - after one month of use and a couple times being flipped over and pushed around by my dog, she can now get into the trays regardless of if the timer is set. I should have weighted it down somehow so she couldn't move the unit around.  She chewed pieces of the white feeding trays off as well.

B0002DJ4SO_47297	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I can only speak for keeping gerbils in this cage and it's not good.  Gerbils by nature obviously love to chew, however even with ample chew toys they love this tank as they love to nibble on it.  Pros: 1. Very easy to take apart and clean with the exception of the wheel. 2. The top compartment was a nice feature.  The gerbils loved to nest there etc.. But don't expect them to stick around in it for petting. 3.  Adequate size for 2 gerbils 4.  I liked how the water bottle fastened to the back outside of the cage.  Cons 1.  Plastic so expect it to get chewed on.  It won't get chewed open but they will chew and it can get very loud during the evening when the kiddos are trying to sleep.  We had to keep it in a separate room with the door shut.  2.  The wheel was awesome at first.  I loved out they ran in it and the wheel would track around in a circle.  However it was very very poorly designed.  The wheel itself has little slits or air holes in them around the enclosure.  What happens is gerbils poop inside the wheel, then the wheel goes round and round, poop flies round and round and ends up all over the room after escaping the slits.  It was fun to clean on a daily basis.  After a few days the wheel holes were taped up.  However, the tape would have to come off during cleaning making it a very tedious process.  The wheel was also loud.  It lasted about a week before it was removed and replaced with a separately purchased tower.  3.  There's a yellow cap included with the cage that appeared to be used for plugging the upper compartment hole so it can be used to house the gerbils while cleaning the cage.  It didn't fit. Nor did it fit any other holes on the cage.  It ended up in the trash.  Instead we moved the gerbils to a separate box while we cleaned the tank.  4.  The spiral ladder lasted about 3 weeks before being chewed to peaces.  5.  The lower tray was not deep enough for bedding.  Gerbils love to scurry around moving the bedding in different locations.  By nature more often than not gerbils cover their food with bedding.  Because of the shallow tray the bedding ended up on the floor on all sides causing daily vacuuming.  Even minimizing the amount of bedding didn't work because they would use even the smallest amount to move and make a mess.  I really liked what this cage had to offer it just didn't hold up to housing gerbils.  Our next purchase was an all steal cage with an assortment of toys arranged inside with a deep lower tray to keep the bedding in tact as much as we could.  Hope this helps.

B0001ZWZ8O_11240	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	We had put off purchasing a wireless fence but ultimately, a black lab who continued to climb the 5 foot chain link fence convinced us to try it. We had some problems with set up: we were unable to hear consistent, clear beeps in order to set up the flags. We replaced them several times but persevered and did our best. Then we had problems with training. We were likewise unable to hear the beeps consistently or well. We had an extra battery so replaced batteries in both collars until we had the best we could receive, but we still were not able to always hear beeps. We placed two calls to the company for support and were advised first to move the transmitter since metal could interfere with transmitting. Since a house is full of metal, we wondered how well it would work with that possibility of interference. We shifted its position a little but couldn't make a major move to keep the boundaries where we wanted. We were also advised that the dogs may hear the beeps because they can hear better! Well, we're supposed to train them and we have to hear the beeps in order to do that! After a couple of weeks of attempt to train per instructions, by bringing them back upon hearing the beep, we just let 'em go. It took one shock for each dog for them to get the message. They then became afraid of parts of the yard. We are now reintroducing them to safe parts of the yard and making progress. They have stayed inside the boundary but are no longer confined to the backyard fence, and we like this.  Maybe others have found training and hearing the beeps easier, but I would caution prospective buyers to be aware of this potential problem. I also did not care for the company's lack of responsiveness to our dilemma.  All dogs would probably not respond as well, but we knew one person who turned on the system and let the dog out. We had not wanted to do this but in the long run, our dogs (lab mixes) pretty much ended up with the same type of training and we could avoided weeks of aggravation if we'd done this to begin with. They got the message and were not harmed.  Contrary to some reviews, our older male lab seems to know when he has the receiver collar on. Without it, he has twice climbed the fence like the old days and gone for a dip in the pond.

B0002DJ9OS_47109	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I had bought one of these Penn Plax Cascade filters when I bought my 40 gallon tank off of craigs list.  When I bought it it came with a big hang on the back kind and I was getting tired of hearing it all the time so I bought the 65 gallon version of this,  My fish tank was always crystal clear after that.  These are a pain to clean but I found the easiest way is to disconnect the hoses from the top of the unit and then carry the whole thing to the bath tub.  When cleaning, you also want to make sure you rinse out the motor head otherwise it spits all of the stuff in their all over your tank when you restart it after changing the media and carbon.  I recently up-sized to a 90 gallon for my African Cichlids and bought the 350gph version and it's been great.  The only thing is the canister is very tall so make sure it fits in your tank stand before buying it.  Mine barely fits but I make it work.  The replacement media is easy to find.  you can buy it here or they also sell it at PetCo.  What I did was buy a carbon media bag here on amazon and then buy a container of activated carbon from PetCo or here and use that to refill and replace the carbon in this filter rather than buying their carbon pack.  It works great and is far less expensive.  If you are on the fence and thinking about this filter, jump of and buy it.  You will be so glad you did!

B0002DK26C_51239	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	This toy is surprisingly more difficult than it looks. It only has one hole, which is fairly large, but it has a lip on the inside, which make the kibble not come out as fast. It is large enough to hold my 85# dogs entire meal (I got the large size). The fewer kibbles that are inside, the more difficult the toy becomes. The ball is very flexible so mine can scrunch it, but it is durable. Overall I really like it for all pets at all levels of experience with puzzle solving, but... the most inconvenient thing is cleaning it. It is not the easiest to clean.  It doesnt unscrew or anything.... so you just have to rinse it out through the one hole and then let it air dry on a mat.

B0002C7FHC_38396	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"I was a bit skeptical as we needed to use this collar on a 60 lb. lab mix that is not the brightest.  Fortunately it's really seemed to do the trick.  Before the collar she would stand outside and bark at seemingly nothing, non-stop, anytime we let her out.  It was especially frustrating in the early morning.  The collar ended that the first day.  She barked...hesitated...barked again...then nothing.  Every now and then she'll whine to get inside, but that is much, much quieter so I'm sure my neighbors are okay with the change.  Occasionally she'll bark once anyway, but it's never prolonged anymore.  I do have to check and make sure the prongs are lined up and making contact (particularly since our lab has a pretty thick coat)-but it's pretty obvious when they are. This really does work, and it's a good value for the money compared to some of the others out there.  I haven't had to replace the battery yet, but we're hoping that once she ""gets it"" the collar won't be necessary for long periods of time.  We show it to her before we put it on every time, so hopefully soon  all we'll have to do is show it to her.  I was very hesitant and researched a lot of products before landing on this one and I'm happy with my selection."	lab mix that is not the brightest.	24:33	90:99	PetSafe Basic Bark Control Collar for Dogs 8 lb. and Up, Anti-Bark Training Device,  Waterproof, Static Correction, Canine		brightest		a 60 lb. lab mix	dogs	dogs	intelligence	positive	n		
B00023XCYG_12437	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Summery: Works great for trapping litter, but for $18 you basically get a cheap square of carpeting.  Pros: Large, litter effectively trapped  Cons: Price, almost too large, I had to cut it down to fit in the space I keep the litter.  The thing I noticed almost immediately when I opened the packaging was the LitterMaid is extremely similar material to an old doormat I had. On my next trip to target and upon checking their discount doormat I found the very same ridged carpet doormat for about 5 dollars (you can just search their website for the cheapest one, you'll see what I mean). On the plus side, it works great, in the last two weeks I haven't had to sweep up any litter outside my cat's box. Given I have hardwood floors, and my Cat's hairy Maine Coon paws seem almost designed TO track litter around, I have to say I'm satisfied.  But my advice to you is to buy a cheap door mat and cut it to fit your space, because that's basically what you're buying here.

B0002C7FFE_39575	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	For years I used Frontline Plus with good results. A few years ago I started noticing some fleas on my dog that had become immune to the Frontline. One thing led to another and before I knew it, I had a massive outbreak on my hands. The fleas were in my yard, house and garage, all while my dog was still on Frontline Plus! I read several articles online discussing how fleas were becoming immune to the Frontline Plus, and my dog was living proof.  I switched my dog to K9 Advantix, and within just a few minutes, fleas were falling off dead. We bombed the yard and garage, and did boric acid treatments on our carpet to keep the fleas off of us humans, but my dog was happy and flea-free. It's been years now, and I have never seen another flea.  Some advice on application: DO NOT give your dog a bath for at least 1 week before or after application!!!! Your dog's fur/hair needs to be coated with its natural oils in order for this product to soak in properly. Most people over wash their dogs anyway, so give the poor thing a break with the bathing, and let the product do its thing. If your dog has dry hair or skin, add some salmon oil to its daily diet, then try the Advantix again.  As far as the ordering process goes, it was flawless. I received my Prime delivery in 2 days, and the price was the lowest I've found anywhere. I would give this product 10 stars if I could.

B0002DIRXC_48570	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	We've only had this for one day so far, but I'm really impressed with the large product.  First: This is for a 12 week old Maine Coon, meaning that he will stress the limits of this cat carrier.  We had to use it as soon as it arrived to take him to the vet - its large enough to fit him, a toy, and a shirt for some warmth. It's cold in NYC right now, but the carrier was nice for him.  That's not the part I'm happy about though. After the vet, I really thought he's never going to want to step foot in this carrier again. We opened it up and set it off to the side.  Now, YMMV, but for us? Our brave little kitten went in on his own after a while! He sort of hunkers down in it for a while, since its a fairly enclosed spot for him to sit in. Hopefully he'll continue to be OK with using it and playing around it.  Now, this isn't super useful for a prospective buyer - a lot of this is subjective. That said, it worked for us! And its the largest carrier I could find for a large cat that seemed to be from a reputable brand. At the vet, someone had that carrier - for their puppy! That says something if you're using this for one of the larger cat breeds.  There's no guarantee this will hold up when he gets older - but I think the 22 pound limit is more related to the stitching that holds the belt / handle to the bag. There might be a way of reinforcing those to help keep it steady beyond that weight limit.  The mesh sides are nice - I kind of wish they had the flaps the medium sized bag has, because it gets cold in NYC. We just tossed a blanket over two of the sides and left one mesh open for us to talk to him through. That's my only real complaint regarding the build.	That said, it worked for us!

B0002AT3MO_37293	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Love this crate SO much. We have a relatively small dog--Miniature Aussie mix, she's only about 18 pounds, and so we had the crate divided for a while for potty training. After she got more used to it, and was all trained in, it allowed us to remove the divider and so now she has a bit more room to toss and turn anxiously waiting for us to get home from work.  She loves her crate, and her latest trick is to close the door behind her after she gets in (tied a rag to the door and taught her to tug on it) we even catch her snoozing in it sometimes when the door is open and she doesn't have to be in it.

B00004T2WR_488	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	UPDATE:  I am updating my review to alert people that it seems that this product has been discontinued, and that the closest formula to it that I've been able to find is Iams Premium Protection Adult Cat formula.  I hope this helps someone.  Iams owned the Eukanuba brand before both the Iams and Eukanuba brands were sold to P&G, and then P&G sold both the Iams and Eukanuba brands to Mars in 2014.  It seems that Mars has decided to just go with the Iams brand name for their cat foods, although the Eukanuba dog foods appear to still be available.  The cat foods are no longer listed on the Eukanuba website.  Since the same manufacturer owns both brands, hopefully the Iams brand will be just as good.  Original review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat. The best way to purchase these foods is in the largest size bags as it is less expensive by weight that way. I will keep buying Eukanuba whatever it takes to do so because it gives my cats the absolute best health.

B000084DWM_4881	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I was given a couple small bags of Science Diet Original by the shelter when I chose the oldest scrawniest kitty. I feed him a can of wet food a day a heaping teaspoon at a time, which equates to about ten times a day. (Anymore than a teaspoon, he'll leave to dry out then irresistibly purr meow for something fresh.)  I leave a small bowl of Science Diet Original out for him as well. I think he eats the Science Diet Adult Original because it's good and smelly to his old nose.  He exclusively eats that at night since I'm not up to replenish his wet food. It took less than two weeks for him to grow to normal weight and become active. (Sometimes dashes around the house just for fun.)  He's thriving.

All of her color on one side was absent and her dorsal fins were clamped down. Third day she tried to eat, but  couldn't raise herself up to suck in the pellets. Each day I saw more improvement! I have finished the full seven day treatment and Miss Piggy is back to her old self. Gobbling her food like a Hoover vac. The color on her side is slowly returning and fins are up.

B0002DHY4K_44243	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I've been using Whisper PFs for all my aquariums for over 20yrs and have never been disappointed by them.  As with any filtration, you should always get a filter that's rated higher than what you need -- for example, if you have a 60 gallon aquarium, the filter's MINIMUM GPH (gallons per hour) rating should be no less than 80 GPH -- because all filters lose filtering capacity over time as media gets dirty and/or loses effectiveness.  Aquariums housing particularly messy and/or big fish need filters that can turn the water volume over at least 3x per hour -- for example, a 60 gallon Goldfish aquarium needs a filter capable of no less than 180 GPH.  It's for this reason that people have issues with filters not keep their aquariums clean.  Whisper PFs are exceptional!  Very well constructed and most are very quiet.  The Whisper 60 is the biggest model and is also the noisiest of the bunch.  They're not insufferable, though, but you can hear them working compared to their smaller cousins.  Usually the noise is caused by impeller assemblies not being seated properly and/or air being trapped in the impeller compartment.  Should ALWAYS add the impeller assembly into the motor housing after adding water to that compartment so air doesn't get trapped inside.  The cover tends to rattled from the vibration generated by the motor, but putting a rock or something like that on top of it eliminates that issue.  The Whisper 60 has a 2 compartment system which makes these filters extremely versatile!  Using the filter pouches, you can add any media you want.  I always keep one side stuffed with blue bonded media and sponge type media for beneficial bacterial to take on biological filtration which keeps the water crystal clear even with no chemical/mechanical media in use.  The other compartment is used for chemical and mechanical filtration.  Keep in mind that carbon by itself isn't 100% effective in keeping aquariums clean, so the carbon packets that come with the filter media for these filters isn't particularly useful -- especially since there is so little of it.  I used PhosPure & Sea Gel and have also used Diamond Blend in the past for media.  To sum up, these are excellent filters and pretty quiet when setup & maintained properly.  I've had 5 of these 60's so far and never had an issue with them.  I also have the Junior and 30 model in operation currently.  My 300+ gallon planted Goldfish aquarium has two of these 60s keeping it crystal clean.

B0002DISI6_47802	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	The bag was a disaster from start to finish (and it finished quickly).  First the zippers were very diffcult to close as they kept sticking and stopping.  The wheels.jammed and the bag.had.to dragged along the floor like a box without wheels. When the dog was inside the slightest movement caused the bag and the dog to flip over on its side.  The bag says it accomodates a dog up to. 22 lbs and mine only weighs 13 lbs, but I bought the large version to give him.more room.

B00028HN5K_21028	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	I used to home cook for 4 large dogs, so rehydrating some Dr. Harvey's and adding meat is not such a big deal. The toughest part is convincing the dogs they have to wait 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Dr. Harvey's is pricey, and I used to mix it with a dry food to stretch my dollar, but the dogs gained weight and weren't really getting the benefit of being on a minimally processed food. Since switching to straight Dr. Harvey's, all three dogs have lost weight and look great. Lets face it--if a steady diet of processed food is not healthy for humans, it's not healthy for any living creature. My ethical dilemma is that I don't eat meat, so I hate buying it and handling it. But the dogs get so excited when I prepare their Dr. Harvey's! I just don't think they would feel the same about beans or tofu. Our 12 year old rottie mix even jumps--she doesn't jump for much these days, so that's her testimonial.  Dr. H has come out with a new line of freeze dried food that has raw meat included (Oracle). It's more expensive, but that's less meat I have to buy and cook. All 3 dogs get Oracle for their morning meal and Canine Health for their evening meal (that's the one they especially like). I think it's worth paying the money up front for a healthy food rather than paying it to the vet for health problems.  I have spoken with Dr. Harvey several times, and he has recommended supplements for my old girl at no cost for the consultation. He truly cares about the animals, and I trust that he is making a food that is good for them.  I highly recommend Dr. Harvey's.

B0002ARQT6_28645	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"I've got 5 crazy ferrets ranging from 1lb - 3.8lb and they always seem to find a way out of everything and into things they're not supposed to be in!! With this playpen (and matching playpen floor mat) I've only had 1 that has managed to get over the top of it - he is my longest ferret though and I maintain he got a really lucky jump or stood on one of the other ferrets because he hasn't been able to do it since. The playpen stands about 3ft tall (I'm only 5ft and it comes up a little past my hip). It is plenty big enough for my 5 to run around and dook, but I'll eventually get the 3 pannel extension to give them just a bit more space. When I'm done with the pen and they are ready to go back to bed, it folds up (almost completely) flat and is small enough for me to slide between the wall and my entertainment center so it is always handy next to their cage in the living room. also, the mat folds up and I just leave it on top of their FN cage. I think the best part about this playpen is it is made well and sturdy so they aren't able to knock it over. It clasps together along one side with 3 hooks (top, middle, bottom). The bottom hook was a bit hard for me to get into the hole at first, but it just makes me feel more confident that they aren't going to be able to hit it and knock it out of place.  The only downfall for me was the price since it doesn't actually include the playpen floor mat. But, considering that my ferrets are like Houdini and can get out of *almost* anything, it was worth it in the long run and has proven to be a great help with cleaning out the cage and even when I recently moved, I was able to let them have some ""free time"" while we were moving boxes!! Not to mention it makes bath time so much easier so my couch doesn't get soaked with little wet body prints!! All things considered, I would buy this again in a heartbeat and am happy that I finally decided to shell out the money for it!"

B00029QW3S_21842	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"I really don't know what to believe reading most other raving reviews; did I get a bad batch? Is my bird ""special""? My sweet little budgie not only wouldn't eat this but after a first time tasting, wouldn't even get close to it anymore! I read a few of the other reviews, and most bird owners (or should I say, partners?) rave about all the ingredients...sure, very impressive (by the way, for the price charged they should all be organic!) but I have a couple of questions for them because while some reviewers go as far as to list the type and count of ingredients, few (if any) say:  1. How many (which) of those ingredients their birds actually eat? 2. Approximate percentage of the food eaten (or left over/ thrown out)? 2. And a personal question from me, what size are your budgies?? There are some big pieces that wouldn't be very easy to handle even by an African Grey...unbelievable! And whole/shells on sunflower seeds.  I am obviously never buying this again. I know my bird is somewhat picky , however, this is the only food ever that she wouldn't even touch! And believe me, I buy and try lots of various foods for my little ""precious"".  Apparently I am the only one with such a negative experience with this food so don't let my review stop you from trying it.  Cheers.  PS: Forgot to mention, I even tried mixing it with some of her favorite seed mixes, half/half at first going to probably less that 20% and she still wouldn't touch it. Can it be that bad (food or bird :))? Did I get a bad batch? Or did I get the wrong product (for a different bird) even though the label says it is the right one? I guess I'll never know.  Addendum, Dec. 15, 2013 - only a few days after I wrote this review, tragedy; our beloved little Papi has passed the way. She got sick, vomiting, and passed away in a day, didn't even get time to take her to the vet! I should have looked for overnight vets, but I did not and I greatly regret it. Please, PLEASE learn from my experience and take your bird to the vet as soon as he/she displays any symptoms. Needless to say, we are totally devastated, never thought it will hit us so hard. She was the sweetest thing. And our first pet.  Since there was no change we can think of the past couple of weeks other than trying to feed her this new Dr. Harvey's food which she tasted a little bit of at first only to totally avoid it afterwards(please read my initial review). I smelled it myself and it does not smell pleasant and I am starting to think about having it tested for molds and/or any other possible dangerous substances. I am wondering where I can have it tested...I will research but if anyone reading this has any suggestion, please let me know asap. Thanks in advance!"

B0001AB42W_9748	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Works like a charm! We have three very stubborn dogs, and did not want them ruining the new furniture. We all tested it on ourselves and we do keep this on the lowest setting. It's more of an annoyance to them (I think the plastic itself would actually do the trick).  Great tips here that I hope will help:  How can I see how many times my pet has tried crossing the Scat Mat? Touch the power pack. The action indicator light will blink back the number of times it has been activated (subtract one for your touch).  Can I use the Scat Mat outside? Due to the wiring, the Scat Mat is for indoor use only.  How do I test my Scat Mat?   Slide the switch on the power pack from OFF to LOW. The red light will blink for 4 seconds and then turn off.   Touch the Scat Mat with the side of your hand, rather than your sensitive fingertips, to test its operation.   Once the Scat Mat senses your touch, its light will illuminate and static pulses will go through the Scat Mat for 3 seconds; you will feel the pulses if you leave your hand touching across 2 wires. (These are visible upon close inspection, separated by about 3 cm  1.25 inches). The Scat Mats light will remain off, except when the mat is activating.  How far apart are the wires in the Scat Mat? The wires are about 1.25 inches apart.  -------------------------------------   Setting up the ScatMat:    Setup   Remove the battery cover by pressing down on the arrow and sliding it forward.   Install a new 9V alkaline battery.   Lay the ScatMat down with the buttons facing up.   Snap the power pack to the buttons on the ScatMat. Ensure the buttons are snapped tightly by pushing down firmly.   You are now ready to test your ScatMat.    Testing the ScatMat   Slide the switch on the Power Pack from OFF to LOW. The red light (marked action indicator) will blink for 4 seconds and then turn off.   Touch the ScatMat with the side of your hand, rather than your sensitive fingertips, to test its operation.   Once the ScatMat senses your touch, its Action Indicator lights up and sends static pulses to the ScatMat for 3 seconds; you will feel the pulses if you leave your hand touching across 2 wires. (These are visible upon close inspection, separated by about 3 cm (1.25 inches).   The ScatMats light will remain off, except when the mat is activating.  --------------------  Training    My pet is not responding to the Scat Mat.   Confirm that the unit is working and that the batteries are fresh.   Increase the correction to the next highest level.

B0002AQZKC_26923	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"We have 2 indoor cats at home who are smart enough to knock on the doors and let you know they want in or out. At first your reaction to this is ""oh look at the cute, smart, well behaved cat who follows good door knocking protocol"". After a while you realize that instead of you training the cat, its the cat that has been training you.... to be their BUTLER! 20 times a day they knock on doors to get in or out, and by then you are already asking for mercy.  That's when this pet door came in. Ordered it and was delivered pretty much in the expected amount of time (we live in Puerto Rico so Prime takes more time to deliver over here). The door comes in a simple cardboard box with good instructions, 4 screws, 4 plastic spacemakers (if your door is too thick or if you need to make space between the 2 sides). It also comes with a cardboard guide so you can use it to make the opening on your door.  We did not use the space makers since the door we used it on is an aluminum screen door. We just marked the opening with a marker using the guide, and proceeded to use a jigsaw.  PRO TIP 1: use a drill first to make a guide hole before using the jigsaw. Choose the correct saw blade depending on the material. Remember saw blades are measured by teeth count. PRO TIP 2: remember to measure twice and cut once. The instructions tell you to place the door at a height where the bottom of the door is almost touching your pet's belly. We made a mistake and mounted it a bit too low, and our cats have to bend down a little to get through. They are cats so they don't really mind the bending.  Perhaps a small dog will not want to bend. PRO TIP 3: Also mark and drill the holes for the screws AFTER you make the opening. if you mess it up, there's always a bit of wiggle room with this door. PRO TIP 4: Choose the right product for the thickness of your door. Some of these doors are made for thicker or thinner doors. This one worked well for an aluminum door that is just made from a 1/8 thick panel.  Mounting was fairly easy once the opening was made. We drilled 1/8 inch holes for the screws and used a cordless driver (in the lowest torque setting) to make it easy on us (since you will probably be sitting down or kneeling for this).  Once the mounting was done, we had to re-train our cats to use the door. This takes a bit of persuading, because the cats wanted to keep using us as their own personal butlers. We had a long talk with them and explained that they had to open their own doors now. We had to force them (gently of course) in and out of the door a couple of times until they understood what it was for. They will paw at it for a while but will not like the magnet at first. Just motivate them with treats and after a couple of days they will be fine. Our cats started consistently using it after the first day.  PROS: - Magnet works amazingly well. It shuts the door tightly so critters and other vermin cant get in. - Looks good and will cover any mistakes you make when perforating the opening once you mount it. - Easy to mount with the 4 screws provided (DONT OVERTIGHTEN) - Cats get used to it pretty quickly. - No more cat butlers in our home. - Sturdy enough. Door is made of hard plastic. - Not very costly compared to similar products.  CONS: - The door does has a lock, but it is a full lock. Meaning you can't lock it for going out or in , independently. Other products do this. Sometimes you will want to let your pet come back in, and not go back out (at night for example). You won't be able to do this with this product. - Somehow... my cats learned to open the door even when its locked. So the lock doesn't work that well. It's not a deal-breaker for us."

B0001ZWZ8O_11080	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	"I purchased and returned this item.  I live on a hobby farm and wanted an invisible fence to train a new dog to stay at home.  I spent hours installing the fence to the maximum size exactly as instructed. All seemed well.  When it came time to try it, I put the shock collar around my hand and tested it on myself (wanting to see how it would actually impact my dog).  I received random shocks within the periphery of the ""safe zone""!  The customer service representatives themselves were nice, responsive and tried to be helpful.  It was not determined exactly why I was being shocked but the most likely theory was that the shocks were being caused by ""environmental interference"".  The possibilities included: (1) a wooden shed for my horses with a tin roof- even though that area of shocks was 25 feet from this and within a straight line to the house and transmitter. (2.) a barbed wire fence- ""could be causing some interference"" (3) a steel propane tank- again, even thought it was not in the ""line of transmission"". (4.) Cars in the driveway were listed as possibilities, etc. Anything metal that causes the collar to lose it's signal will shock your dog.  My huge complaint and worry is that this caution should be in large letters and emphasized in the descriptions and literature.  The trouble shooting only says the ""collar activates ifs a large metal object is between the collar and transmitter"", etc.  but the transmitter WAS in clear shot of the collar when I received shocks on a number of occasions.  I am so glad I didn't put this on my dog to test!  Teaching her to stick close will just need to be done the old fashioned way- taking an obedience class, learning positive behavioral techniques and practice."

B0001VJD5Q_10757	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	Update 12/11/15: I finally found eye protection for my dog that is perfect (well, almost), The Rex Specs are my number one choice for dog eye protection from the sun. You can see my video review of them here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYBWTCI1SXTA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm  Now back to my original review:  First off, my dog (85 lb German Shepherd) has pannus. The purpose of doggles is to protect his eyes from UV light so that he doesn't go blind. I could care less about the coolness factor, this review is strictly based on the ability to protect my dogs eyes from the sun, and his comfort in wearing them.  Second, I'm writing the same review for all the doggles, as a comparison, so you don't have to go looking through my other reviews to see how well the other types of doggles worked, or didn't work.  Third, I only make my dog wear them when it is sunny or overcast outside. I generally try to take him for walks/runs when it is either early morning/evening, or cloudy days. But he's full of energy, so I have to take him out on sunny days. This is when he wears doggles.  With the disclaimers aside:  1st choice:  Doggles Mesh Eyewear  I only recently tried these, and wish I had tried them sooner. I think what kept me from buying these is that in the photos, it appears as if your dog is not able to see through these, and because it only protects from 50 to to 60% of UV light. After spending ridiculous amounts of money in search for the perfect eye protection on every kind of doggle out there, this has become my first choice, though still far from perfect.  My dog can see very well with these, tolerates these the best out of all the other doggles. Will play with these on, and even chase a ball if other dogs are around chasing the same ball. I have noticed that sometimes he can't follow the toy as well, but that seems to be based on how fast the toy is flying and how high I throw it. So I still have to change how I play with him, but at least now he will play with eye protection on, which is huge.  The mesh is very light, which is why I think he doesn't mind it. It is kind of awkward looking as the mesh has pointy ends that cause it to stick out and not be laying directly on his eyes. I had my dog wear these for a full day once, and when coming back inside, I noticed he didn't rub his eyes against the couch as much as he does with other doggles.  The only reason I can't give this five stars is because it is only 50 to 60% uv protection rather than a 100% as offered with other doggles. This is a concern for me as the UV rays can really damage my dogs eyes due to the pannus. However, since my dog doesn't try to take these off anywhere near as much as the other doggles, I feel he gets a lot more protection from these since he actually keeps them on.  Since trying these, I have bumped down the ranking on the other doggles as noted below.  1st and 2nd choice: Doggles Large K9 Optix sunglasses, frameless  These are by no means perfect, and I fear the day they get broken. So far they have lasted several months with taking extreme good care of them. The reason they are one of my top choices is because they are 100% UV protection and my dog minds them the least (with the exception of the mesh doggles which are half the UV protection). I think what he hates about most doggles is that they have a bulky and heavy frame (from a dog's perspective), and they are not one lens, thus making them heavier on his head, and reducing his visibility. With these frameless doggles he does generally well, and is only intolerant of them when he's bored. He doesn't try to take these off as much, and as long as I have him distracted (going to a new place or chasing a critter), he doesn't mind them. He will more often than not play ball or catch a Frisbee with these on, but sometimes not. I wish I could give these five stars, but they are flimsy, and will fall apart eventually. I gave it four stars simply because they have held together thus far, with extra care. What really made this my top choice, is that they are frameless. I can see a huge difference in how my dog sees through these doggles in comparison to other doggles. So this gets first place simply for his comfort in vision. The straps fit nicely behind his ears and under his chin. If only they were made a little more sturdy...  I am making these both my first and second choice because the mesh eyewear only offers half of the UV protection that these do, and I can't use the mesh eyewear on really bright sunny days due to lack of the UV protection.  2nd choice: Doggles OriginalZ  The doggles originalZ only come with one color lens, which really isn't a big deal, but I have learned that even on overcast days, my dog needs eye protection, and he's less tolerant of these on overcast days versus on very sunny days. I think the darkness of the lens may reduce his visibility. He tries to paw his doggles off more so than with the frameless pair, but he minds these less than the ILS doggles. Overall, I'm happy with these because he does do fairly well with them when distracted, but I can tell he dislikes them. He usually will not chase a ball or Frisbee with these on, especially if there are other dogs around. I think he can't see the ball/Frisbee as well, and other dogs can, so he just gives up. Unless we're doing something new and exciting, he generally will find a shady spot, lay down, and watch the world play around him. It's sad to see him this way, but going blind will be worse for him, so I keep making him wear them. The doggles are well designed with the strap that goes behind his head and under his chin, which is easily adjustable, and vent holes on the sides of the doggles so that his eyes don't sweat/fog up.  3rd choice: Doggles ILS  I started out with the ILS doggles since they were the newest doggle out, and I liked the idea of the interchangeable lenses. I tried several colors of lenses, and found that my dog minds the brown lenses the least. It is nice to be able to remove the lenses that are scratched up and replace them with shiny new ones, and it's also nice to put in the clear lenses for overcast days when I want my dog to be able to see more, with the darkest lenses on really sunny days. So why not my favorite doggle? The dog hates them. The design is almost the same as the originalZ, with a few differences. The straps seem about the same as the originalZ, and the vent holes only differ in shape. The nose piece seems to be further apart than the originalZ, and even though the frame, when compared to the originalZ when not on, seems the same, they are a lot bulkier when on. I also found the foam that is between the doggles and the dogs eye is a little different, and seems to fall apart easier than the originalZ. The doggles company actually was kind enough to throw in some free foam with my latest order, but even super gluing it didn't seem to hold it well in place. Because the ILS doggles are much bulkier than the originalZ, and the dog hates bulky things on his face, he tries harder with these than any other doggles to get them off. Often, I find him running back to me with his doggles all distorted on his face with the straps all tangled. I have no idea how he manages, but it's sad to see him running back to me for help to fix his doggles, which I'm sure he's hoping I take off. No way would he even consider chasing a ball or catching a Frisbee with these on.  Last choice: Doggles K9 Optix Blue Rubber Gradient Frame with Smoke Lens Sunglasses  These are almost frameless, top of the frame is very thin, so my dog didn't seem to mind them as much, however, they broke within a week, even with very careful use, and constant watching of my dog so that he doesn't paw at them, and taking care to put them in a safe place when not in use. These were my favorite except for the fragility of them, until I found the frameless.  Okay, for those designers out there that want to make the perfect doggle, I hope you are reading this. You need a single lens doggle that is still very durable, sturdily built, and not too bulky. Basically, a single lens across both eyes, with a very light frame if any, such as the mesh with a softer plastic that is still 100% UV protection. Dogs are not human and do not see like humans, so why only create something that works for humans is beyond me. The frames in between the eyes are bothersome to the dog, and the bulk of most doggles (especially the ILS) causes discomfort. I actually bought a pair of ski goggles for humans and ended up sewing a chin strap to it to see if that would work, but it was too bulky and he was able to get them shook off by just shaking his head. But I could tell that his eyesight was just fine with the single lens.  Lastly, when back inside and we remove the doggles, my dog immediately runs to the couch and rubs his eyes against it, which we talked to the dog eye specialist about. It was suggested, that after wearing doggles, rather than let the dog rub his eyes against objects, that we put icepacks on his eye area. Just a little hint for those who have the same problem.

B0002ARYL6_30804	Reviews_Pet_Supplies	My pets, big pitbulls, love this red 14-inch diameter ball. The ball is HUGE and made of extremely hard plastic. They roll it around the yard, sometimes flopping over the ball itself. Watching them play is a hoot. With the heat outside, I must keep them to 5 or 10 minutes at a play stretch, else they would keep on going until they literally dropped.  This red ball, and the Jolly Pet Yellow Egg (largest one), are the boy's most favorite toys. They don't need another playmate, and actually do better playing with the toy by themselves. It can get loud if played on cement or indoors.  My guys put holes in the Jolly Pet egg (so they can pick it up and carry it around), but have not been able to do the same with the red ball. The diameter is actually larger than their jaw span, which was the plan when I bought the largest ball.  This 14-inch ball is great for big dogs, especially herding dogs. Pitbulls seem to like this and other Jolly Pet toys, which are some of the best made pet toys.  The ball comes in various diameters, so I am sure other dogs will also like this toy, if you get the size that is perfect for them. I would buy one that is larger than their jaw span so they cannot pick it up. The most fun seems to be in batting it around and following it to bat it again. The dogs tend to use their noses more than their arms (which they use for the Jolly Egg as if the egg was a soccer ball). Mine like to stand on the ball with their front paws and try to move it. It really is hilarious. Will try to post a video of the guys playing.

This made his performance in Conan the Barbarian look like he was a classic Shakespearean in comparison. The movie was so bad that our church youth group wanted to leave early - on a mission trip when they would have to sleep on a church floor when they left the theater. I love Arnold over all - minus the last few years as governor when he failed miserably as in this movie.

767853636_16995	Reviews_movies_tv	"It's the 1930's, and Annie has been left at an orphanage run by the evil Miss Hannigan.  The only thing that keeps her looking forward to ""Tomorrow"" is the hope that her parents will come back to get her.  One day her luck changes when she's invited to spend Christmas with Oliver Warbucks, the billionaire.  After he comes to care for Annie, he starts a search for her parents.  But when Miss Hannigan gets wind of the reward, she gets involved in a plan to swindle Warbucks and kidnap Annie.  Can she be stopped?I love the musical in its stage version, and was disappointed with the original movie.  I prefer this version because it sticks closer to the original.  While some things have been changed, most notably some references to the time period, the heart of the story remains intact.  This is very commendable considering it's running time is an hour less then the play on which it is based.  It always brings a smile to my face and keeps me humming the tunes for days.The cast is also wonderful in their roles.  Alicia Morton is perfect as Annie.  Victor Garber makes a great ""Daddy"" Warbucks, and I love watching Kristin Chenoweth.  But for me the biggest surprise was Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan.  I was worried that she wouldn't be able to play the part, but she does an outstanding job.  In fact, I find her sober Miss Hannigan scarier (and much less annoying) then Carol Burnett's in the original movie.Fans of the original movie version will probably be disappointed with the trimmings made to make the story shorter and more like the play.  But if you can set that aside, be prepared for a night of musical entertainment a small step away from the stage."

767834739_14983	Reviews_movies_tv	As it is the case with most sequels, this second instalment of &#34;Resident Evil&#34; franchise is significantly inferior to the first film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILLERS.This film begins 30 days after the contamination of the Hive described in the first &#34;Resident Evil&#34; movie. In opening scenes the Umbrella Corporation attempts to unseal the Hive in order to eliminate its undesirable occupants and reclaim this huge, precious facility. It is suggested that this attempt doesn't go very well... Some days later Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an abandoned hospital in Raccoon City, naked, bruised and unable to remember jack... And then the film really begins.The biggest problem with this film is that there is virtually no scenario, just a succession of shootouts and running. There is hardly any dialogs which would merit to be remembered, the sense of humour seems to have been completely eaten by zombies, most of decisions taken by people (both villains and good guys) doesn't make the slightest sense and let's not even talk about character development...Milla Jovovich was asked to play here just a standard issue superhuman shooting machine and was clearly forbidden by the director to do and say anything else than shooting - and her two principal sidekicks, with whom she joins ultimately after more than 40 minutes (!) of film are even worse!Sienna Guillory plays Jill Valentine, a police officer belonging to the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) who has the habit of coming to work dressed as a streetwalker and greatly praised may she be for that, because this firmer model is a supremely beautiful woman with such a figure, that Phidias and Praxiteles would KILL for the privilege of sculpting her (in more sense than one...). BUT, an actress she is REALLY not and even saying two lines of dialog is for her clearly an effort... And as for her character being an action hero, well, let's just say that she cannot even hold correctly the prop gun they gave her, because this thing clearly scares her...Oded Fehr plays Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from Umbrella Corporation private army - but being a simple soldier, he is completely unaware of all the evil plans of his bosses and in this film he actually is one of the good guys. Oded Fehr, who usually plays Bedouin holy warriors, demons from Hell or Arab terrorists, has of course all the necessary competence and physical attributes to make an awesome, legendary, bad@ss mercenary - but he is not really allowed in this film to do much. His character is just a subdued sidekick of Alice...Another big issue with this film, that everything is centred around Alice and it really is hard to understand why is she SOOO important? Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? But even worse, Alice enters the movie for real only after 40 minutes and in the meantime nothing really very important happens...The second part of the film (once Alice appears) is slightly better than the completely useless first 40 minutes, but the operative word here is &#34;slightly&#34;. There is a couple of good action scenes, but they are few and short. Of course, between those good action scenes quite a lot of munitions gets expended but mostly it is just a shooting of various fish in the barrels.There is one sequence, involving an elementary school, which is not bad and will certainly delight all those who simply hate kids and puppies. It also makes sense that in the middle of an anthropophagic zombie infestation an elementary school is a particularly dangerous place, because playful kids need hearty balanced meals on a regular basis...))) On another hand the director couldn't follow this idea until its logical conclusion, because then this film would probably be banned in most countries...The ending logically opens the way for the next film in the franchise and ask again the same question: Alice! Who the (----) is Alice?Bottom line, this film is really not good and I managed to suffer through it all the way until the end only with some fast forwarding here and there (especially during all the one sided shootouts). This DVD is definitely NOT a keeper. Avoid!

767836359_15644	Reviews_movies_tv	The narrative of Robert Redford is captivating, uplifting, and graceful.  'On the banks of the Big Blackfoot River....' a place I've been, and long to return.  Nothing, el zippo, tops the splendor and majesty of Montana, nothing even comes close!  It's timeless valleys, raging aqua-tinted torrents, and green alpine towns and villages dispersed all throughout its western landscapes define 'National Treasure.'  Missoula, Montana, home to the Maclean family, is a good old fashioned town of turmoil and unsetteldness squaring off against an unmistakable serenity with nature's works and ways.  'To the beat of a four count rhythm....' might not be the most instructive of flyfishing casting approaches (I've lost many a woolybugger in willow trees climbable only by the most inane of flytiers), but it makes for undulating cinema.  'Oh I could never leave Montana brother...' is a line beckoning truth; after visiting Montana on several occasions (first was an Amtrack train ride in '94... ok a person could easily get up and go from Havre, MT) getting to catch sights of Glacier to the north, the Bitterroot range in the south, and all that lies in between (e.g. Flathead Lake)....there are no fleeting instincts.  A geologist could be lost in paradise in, say, Yellowstone for ages, not even taking into consideration the abundance of mountain ranges lining Montana's western front - stretching north to south, from Great Falls to Anaconda.  Redford's directing brings along the viewer through every imaginable trace of landmark - riverbanks, pubs, train stations, backyard fields with forest and mountain top afar, and even a couple sunburned rawhides!  Not a favorite still shot.  Boats are stolen, category 'forget about it' white waters are paddled through, unpaid gambling wagers bring conflict wrought with misunderstanding, dinner table discussions of Calvin Coolidge's fishing secret '...what are they bitin on?....The end of my line!' and job satisfaction are brought up, shortcuts winding their way through train tunnels are taken, and in the end, reflection and memories are revealed in honest fashion.  Verdant pastures and picueresque backdrops steal the film's premise, offering more than just basic storyline.  But the moment of closure is why I adore Robert Redford's film set in Missoula....in addition to the melancholic violin intermezzos.'On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.'Anyone ever visiting Montana will register in their sights and other senses this inescapable impression.  Don't forget, if you're going to fish these pristine waters (i.e. Yellowstone, Clearwater Creek, Madison, Bighorn, Big Hole, Gallatin, Beaverhead, Kootenai Rivers), catch-and-release is the only real keeper!  A River Runs Through It is a Montana dreamscape.  Once more, if going there, remember to 'Enjoy the Silence.'

767803434_5340	Reviews_movies_tv	"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga ""Air Force One"" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in ""Independence Day."") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make ""Air Force One"" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard ""Air Force One"" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of ""L.A. Takedown""), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember ""Escape from New York?"") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, ""Air Force One"" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit ""Executive Decision."" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller ""Passenger 57"" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both ""Airport 75"" and ""Cliffhanger."" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" franchise and the Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" movies. Finally, the ""Air Force One"" ending should come as no surprise to any ""Star Trek"" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although ""Air Force One"" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between ""Air Force One"" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller ""Das Boot""/""The Boat"" (1981). The casting of ""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of ""Air Force One"" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in ""Das Boot."" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his ""Die Hard"" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the ""Patriot Games"" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout ""Air Force One"" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in ""The Devil's Own"" (1997).The real casting coup in ""Air Force One"" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like ""Quantum Leap's"" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, ""Air Force One"" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time."

783234287_49628	Reviews_movies_tv	Just wanted to mention that I recently compared the transfers on the Mummy Special Edition (Universal Legacy Series) 2-disc DVD released in July 2008 and the original 1999 Universal single-disc DVD release. The quality of the transfers in terms of contrast, brightness, detail, scratches and blemishes, etc., seems to be virtually identical. However, for some unknown reason the framing of the Legacy Series release is cropped tighter than the 1999 edition, with a small but significant loss of picture information along the right, left, and bottom borders. I watched the Legacy Series version yesterday and the missing information was not enough to seriously impact my enjoyment of the movie, but it's kind of irritating that the older, supposedly obsolete edition actually reveals more of the frame than the newer, supposedly definitive edition. Unfortunately, this seems to be typical of Universal's double- and triple-dip DVD editions: two steps forward and one back. I'm still debating whether to hang on to the 1999 edition, which I was hoping to ditch after buying the newest release. So if you're thinking of upgrading in hopes of getting a superior transfer and don't really care about the extras, my advice is stick with the original 1999 release. The only new extras you get with the Legacy Series release are the second commentary track, 1940s Mummy series trailers, and the Jack Pierce featurette, which is interesting but does not contain much new information unless you are completely ignorant of Pierce's career. The Unraveling the Legacy of the Mummy featurette is really just a promo for the two Brendan Fraser Mummy movies, it doesn't even address the 1940s mummy series, or any other mummy movies for that matter. The TCM Universal Horror documentary is nice but it is available on the Dracula and Frankenstein 75th Anniversary Edition DVDs and hardly worth the purchase price of the new Mummy DVD by itself, especially if you already have the Dracula or Frankenstein anniversary sets. If the limited new extras sound worth it to you, go for it, but realize that you are losing some picture information in the feature attraction, not to mention the Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers' Bios, and Mummy Archives (poster and stills gallery) extras from the 1999 release. I never bought the Mummy Legacy Collection box set so I can't comment on that release.

Fans of Shakespeare in Love will roll when they see this movie, for the simple fact that they will pick up many of the subtleties of humor that us &quot;just plain&quot;  Star Wars fans would probably miss.For my own part, after reading the  reviews of this movie when in first came out, I went to the website and  watched the movie online before I bought it.

767817664_9785	Reviews_movies_tv	"Director:  Tom HollandCast:  William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys.Running Time:  105 minutes.Rated R for vampire violence, gore, nudity, and some language.Rivals ""The Howling"" as the quintessential vampire film of the past quarter-decade, ""Fright Night"" excels even more in the humor department.  William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster (perhaps the best, cheesy high-schooler name ever), a regular teenager who finds himself emotionally distraught and disturbed in adolescence, but for much different reasons than any of his classmates.  Charley is convinced that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a blood-sucking, bat-winged vampire and he will stop at nothing to get his friends and family to believe him.As Charley and his girlfriend (played by Amanda Bearse) realize that his initial perceived nightmare is true, they enlist the help of former television vampire hunter has-been Peter Vincent (in a wonderfully funny performance from the great Roddy McDowall) to bring the vampire-next-door to light.  Director Tom Holland uses a great, clever script to near perfection, mixing the elements of terror and tongue-in-cheek humor to the fullest, making ""Fright Night"" one of the most enjoyable and entertaining horror films of the middle decade.  Ragsdale is innocently exceptional with his performance and Sarandon is perfect as the seducing, scheming vamp.  Very good special effects and some great one-liners.  Can be enjoyed to all movie-goers, not just buffs of the horror genre.  A true campy, cult landmark."

780020715_18485	Reviews_movies_tv	Watching &#8216;La belle et la bete&#8217; the other day was a profoundly moving experience for me.  &#8216;Beauty and the Beast&#8217; has always been one of my favorite fairytales, and in many respects it has been my favorite.  I still remember the day that I saw the Disney film for the first time.  I was six years old and my whole family went to the theater together.  I was obsessed at a very young age with this timeless classic, and while my early years were consumed with Disney&#8217;s presentation, I soon grew into exploring other facets of this tale.  From the stage play to the television series to variations of the book, I have loved everything I have been able to get my hands on.But for some strange reason, I had not ever seen this critically acclaimed and beloved French adaptation, until now.More so than just for myself, the magical moments contained in Jean Cocteau&#8217;s magnificent film were shared with my daughters, and that made the experience all the more special.  The rich black and white, the inspired art direction and special effects and the beautiful chemistry between the actors all made for such a delightful movie watching experience, but as I read each word of dialog to my children (yes, I read every word) I could sense a swell of excitement come over the whole room, and when the Prince and Belle leap into the air in the rousing finale to fly off to their kingdom my eldest daughter stood up on the bed and yelled &#8220;this is beautiful&#8221; I knew that this would be one of my proudest cinematic moments as a father.For those only familiar with Disney&#8217;s version of the tale, many aspects of Cocteau&#8217;s beautiful film will be brand new to the viewer.  This tale plays out vastly different, with Belle&#8217;s actual life feeling like a solid mixture of Disney&#8217;s Belle and Cinderella.  Belle is made house servant by her spoiled sisters who treat her, and those around them, like dirt.  Belle has caught the eye of Avenant, a family friend and fellow scoundrel with her brother, Ludovic.  Their father is a man with financial woes, and her brother is a man with even more of them.  On a nightly trip home, Belle&#8217;s father stumbles upon the Beast&#8217;s haunted lair and is condemned to death when he picks one of the Beast&#8217;s beloved roses.  The Beast gives him an ultimatum.  If one of the man&#8217;s children wants to come and die in his place, his life with be spared.  He is to return (or send one of his children) back in three days&#8217; time.Upon hearing her father&#8217;s heartbreaking tale, and taking responsibility, since it was for her that he picked the rose, Belle decides to venture off to the Beast&#8217;s lair in her father&#8217;s place.Here is where the film truly transforms into a visual and emotional spectacle.The tale of the love that forms between the Beast and Belle is done in a much more reserved and innovative way in Cocteau&#8217;s tale.  Instead of the lavish romanticism that we saw with Disney, Cocteau takes his time to develop something darker, earthier in tone.  That isn&#8217;t to downgrade what Disney did with this story at all, for their adaptation is still one of my favorite animated films of all time and is a truly splendid counterpoint to this film, but the differences are obvious.  The approach made to the relationship that forms between the two is one more naturally and believably developed.  The Beast&#8217;s yearning, his inner desperation and his ashamed demeanor are all brought magically to life through Jean Marais&#8217;s stunning performance; and considering that he really only had his eyes to work with is an astonishing feat.  Contrast that with the coolness that pervades Belle&#8217;s subtle acceptance of the Beast and the way that she always portrays the inner beauty of Belle without betraying her obvious fear and feeling of betrayal concerning her situation and you have a shockingly poignant character study that develops real themes of love and understanding, trapped within the beautiful surroundings of a fairytale.This story is so universally loved because it is so universally profound.From a visual standpoint, &#8216;La belle et la bete&#8217; is a stunning piece of cinema.  The rich black and white cinematography engulf every frame, creating a beautiful template for Cocteau to paint his picture.  The costumes and sets are all astonishing to see.  The way that Cocteau took his disadvantages (financially and technologically) and turned them into advantages is just brilliant.  The sets, those living breathing sets, are just breathtaking.And the Beast&#8217;s makeup is so real, so believable, that he&#8217;ll give you chills.With a beautiful score by Georges Auric, who illuminates every scene with the musical progression, &#8216;La belle et la bete&#8217; stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of all time.	The rich black and white, the inspired art direction and special effects and the beautiful chemistry between the actors all made for such a delightful movie watching experience, but as I read each word of dialog to my children (yes, I read every word) I could sense a swell of excitement come over the whole room, and when the Prince and Belle leap into the air in the rousing finale to fly off to their kingdom my eldest daughter stood up on the bed and yelled &#8220;this is beautiful&#8221; I knew that this would be one of my proudest cinematic moments as a father.For those only familiar with Disney&#8217;s version of the tale, many aspects of Cocteau&#8217;s beautiful film will be brand new to the viewer.	531:539	1527:1535	Beauty and The Beast The Criterion Collection		proudest		when the Prince and Belle leap into the air in the rousing finale to fly off to their kingdom my eldest daughter stood up on the bed and yelled “this is beautiful”	my cinematic moments as a father	#0=moments	pride	positive	n		one of
783112750_33281	Reviews_movies_tv	"For me and many (if not most) other film enthusiasts, a film's story and plot - rather than the inclusion of ""A List"" actors (an arbitrary, usually temporary, and essentially meaningless designation) to its cast - is the initial draw (plus a good trailer doesn't hurt); as for rental movies, the reasons can be less geared towards the plot and more geared towards the wondrous aesthetic of bare female skin.  In the World War 2 film WHEN TRUMPETS FADE, viewers get none of the latter aspect but a very commendable example of the former.  It is an excellent story and screenplay with an engagingly ironic premise and an effective cast.  The setting is the Hurtgen Forest, a short distance from the Belgian/German border.  The battle over said real estate was a harrowing and bloody ordeal that inflicted significant casualties on the American troops, who expected a cakewalk following the ongoing German retreat in the wake of the allied liberation of France.  Instead, the allies found the weary German troops consolidated in well-planned defensive positions from which they put forth determined and brutally effective resistance.  The film actually closely follows the details of the battle (one of the longest in U.S. history).In the movie, Ron Eldard stars as David Manning, the lone survivor of his platoon returning to the battalion HQ after a devastating battle and a harrowing incident which followed.  Instead of a brief respite from the horrendous ordeal, Manning is not only put back into combat rotation, but is also assigned as a squad leader.  Manning himself is an underachieving fatalistic malcontent without much interest or effort beyond his own self-preservation.  The Company Commander (in an understated but not entirely ineffective portrayal by Martin Donovan) has no illusions about Manning's character, but comes to recognize an unappealing yet practical truth: that Manning's experience (especially when compared to the inexperienced replacements who reinforce the mauled units) and his ability to survive are tantamount to making him the best candidate for the position (if for no other reason than by default).  Manning continually asks for an exception from combat duty, which is always and immediately refused.  Soon, he is assigned a squad to lead, which is reduced to a mere fire team after an unsuccessful attack by the battalion is savagely repelled by German artillery.  Following this latest debacle, the Captain makes Manning a somewhat remarkable deal: if Manning will lead his 4-man fire team on a seemingly hopeless assault to destroy the German artillery positions, the Company Commander will classify Manning as unfit for combat via a Section 8.Thus, what begins with a suicide mission which the Captain believes will rid him of Manning and the requests for removal from combat duty, spurs an increasing cycle of surprisingly heroic though self-serving actions by Manning that grow in daring and peril.  Along the way in his Faustian bargain, Manning unintentionally displays the leadership, bravery, and heroism that he had no interest in possessing, even if the motives lack nobility.  It is an intriguing question of the nature of heroism: is its essence defined by motive without regards to results, or actions without regard to motive?  As for the characters, there aren't many that are very easy to like in a conventional sense, though you end up rooting for some of them.  Besides Manning's self-centeredness and disdain for authority, the Captain is an earnest but ineffectual commander, the new and unprepared (both in terms of training and psychology) platoon leader (Timothy Oliphant) utterly loses his nerve and mind after a disastrous attack, the Battalion Commander (marginal performance by Dwight Yoakum) is a rear echelon officer who reflects the upper chain-of-command's oblivion to the tactical realities of the battle.  Eldard may not be the greatest actor ever born, but he nails the role and comes off as rather believable - which is or should be the goal of an actor in a film.  Frank Whaley, Dylan Bruno, and Zak Orth all turn in solid performances respectively as a dedicated medic, a tough but jaded sergeant, and the brand new augmentee who transforms from being the platoon's biggest doofus to its most promising soldier through his harrowing experiences.For fans of war movies, the budget is pretty modest (an HBO movie filmed in eastern Europe) with special effects and military props which might not be top of the line as well.  But the violence and gore are frankly depicted, and the terror and tension are palpable (this is the movie which prepared me for the unprecedentedly violent Omaha Beach landing sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN).  There isn't much in the way of soppy sentimentality, though there is an argument that could be made for this film being one of the most realistic and best World War 2 films you never saw.  It is one of my favorite films of all, though this gritty and dark effort doesn't fall into the category of ""feel good movies"".  It's best to be in the right frame of mood for seeing it, though worth the time spent."

783226799_43645	Reviews_movies_tv	Step right up and win some crap! There are so many memorable sound bytes in this movie that it could rival Caddyshack for the honor of greatest quote fest.  Uncommon hilarity and situational goofiness mark this film Steve's comic classic.  This movie has been a family favorite since it debuted on TV in the early eighties, when we were too young to see the uncensored version.  So we got to deal with Navin's dog being named 'Stupid' instead of ..., close examination of the poor dubbing clued us in though.  The TV version also includes parts that the uncensored is missing, ala Navin's bid to be president of Texaco oil and his generous contribution to Donny's airplane seats fund.  It's an old story, one you've probably heard before, witness Navin's inability to find the rhythm as a white man being raised by poor black sharecroppers as their own. Singing the blues with the family doesn't help, because the songs depress him. Not even the sandwich wrapped in cellophane can stem the feeling that he's somehow 'different'. Mother sits him down and in a tender moment tells him he would be loved if he were the color of a baboons 'head'. Upon finding the beat, Navin strikes out on his own to see the world, proceeding past the end of the fence.  My favorite chapter of the film comes next when Navin takes his first job at Jackie Mason's gas station.  This situation leads to some of the juiciest dialogue as Navin haggles for a $1.10 an hour wage, wrangles a rental living space, loses a church to a car-load of credit card toting Latinos including Mr. Neusbaum, and is targeted for termination by a psychotic hit man. Beyond that, Navin finds love and lust, fame and fortune in turn while never forgetting his parents and past `that's a good boy'. Navin's child-like navet&eacute; coupled with his stupidity makes him an extremely endearing character, ultimately capable of winning the hand of Marie [Bernadette Peters], his true love... it also helps that he has a special purpose, 11 million dollars, and daisy stems on his roses.  Watch this film and be brought under Navin's spell, and remember you don't need one other thing... except...	Step right up and win some crap!

783239408_51238	Reviews_movies_tv	"Nearly every year there is one film that has a lot of good qualities, but critics seem to over-praise and over-hype it to the level of a Citizen Kane or a Casablanca.  In 1999, that film was American Beauty.  It is contains lots of morally charged themes and tangents, but not really that much to say.The story itself starts out in the narrative-from-beyond-the-grave style like Sunset Boulevard, in which Lester (played masterfully by Kevin Spacey) describes his shallow and hopeless existence.  He is stuck in a dead-end job that he hates, his wife is an endlessly perky on the surface (but a vicious gold digger/adulteress beneath) suburban professional mom, his daughter is a sullen loner and he can only find solace from these suburban ills in masturbation.Lester decides that he is ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"" and rebels against his shallow and oppresive suburban existence by: quitting his job and blackmailing his boss into giving him a year's pay, smoking pot, lusting after a girl more than half his age (and working out to impress her), buying a fast car without consulting the wife, and taking a fast food job (because it requires the least amount of responsibility).  In other words, he escapes a shallow and oppressive suburban adult existence by reverting to a shallow suburban adolesence.If the quandry that Lester is in doesn't look all that oppresive to people, the writers ratchet up the oppresive quotient by introducing the Marine Corps neighbor: Colonel Fitts.  Fitts is a caricature straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook.  (...)  Col. Fitts, along with Lester's wife, are the least satisfying and most stereotypical in the picture.Out of the entire cast Jane (Thora Birch) seems to be the only one who recognizes the symptoms and the correct cure.  She knows that she desperately needs structure in her life and won't find it from her father or her mother (and most likely not her ""beauty"" obssessed boyfriend).Among the muck described above, there are a few bright spots in the film.  Kevin Spacey is frankly riveting as Lester.  Even though the character is essentially a riff on the character he played in The Ref, he still acts with such verve as to truly deserve the academy award that he won for this role.  In fact, I think its primarily because of Spacey's greatness in this role that so many people have given the entire film such effusive praise.  The cinematography and the score are both excellent as well.In conclusion, while I found some of the film to be excellent and beyond compare of most cinematic releases; taken as a whole, I found it to be less-than-satisfying."

783226799_43604	Reviews_movies_tv	This 1979 debut for Steve Martin is one of comedy's greatest classics. This film definitley opened the door for people like Jim Carrey and all those types of comedies. This one will forever be the granddaddy of them all. Steve plays Navin Johnson, a white man who was brought up by a backwoods family who are black. Navin realizes he's not and sets out on his own to find his own life. It's one misadventure after the next. It's also one hilarious joke after another. Along the way he meets and falls in love with Bernadette Peters. There are also appearences by Carl Reiner, Jackie Mason, and M. Emmett Walsh. The movie is so slapsticky silly that it's hilarious fun to watch from beginning to end. I won't say what happens to our good old friend Navin. You'll have to see for yourself. If only the brilliant Steve Martin would return to this type of comedy. This film is pure comedy gold sent from comedy heaven. A definite must!!.

It's a heavy risk for music artists to sell their name on to the big screen, and believe me,this could go very wrong.  Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but ""Spice World"" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to ""Family Guy"".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.Just to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in ""Pulp Fiction"" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M; club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get togetherand release an album not too long ago, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.  Regardless, this movie is a nonsensical publicity stunt."

767853636_16977	Reviews_movies_tv	"Annie was one of the best Broadway musicals of the past 30 years. It relied on content and talented performers instead of high-tech sets and lighting and un-taltented stars. Andrea McArdle as the loveable orphan was actually 13 as the perfect age to play Annie, who was I believe 12 in the stage show. She had a great voice and was tougher than the usual little girl. As Oliver Warbucks, Reid Sheldon was comic and warmhearted and as the beloved Miss Hanigan, Dorothy Loudon was a cynical, boozing broad, just as the charachter was written.In 1982, Hollywood put its rather dull and child-like stamp on ""Annie."" Not only does this Annie- Aileen Quinn have a horrible voice, but is also cutesy and phony. Albert Finney as Warbucks, although he looks the part, doesn't act the part. There is no pompus humor. As Miss Hanigan, Carol Burnett get the drinking part right, but that's about all she does through the whole movie. Ms. Burnett, although rather funny throughout the film, acts like a drunk through the whole thing. The characther is more than than.I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse, and Ann Reinking is one of his best dancers, however for this film, her taltnents were not shown. She was miscast for the role of Miss Farrel.The story was completely revamped to make Miss Hannigan look like a nice charachter. There was also no Arab servant in the stage show.The music was changed drastically. Did you know ""Tomorrow"" was actually a scene change song in the Broadway show? Well here it is song constantly, terribly as well. ""We Got Annie"" was planned as a song in the Broadway show, but here is sung by a bunch of people who we don't care about. It isn't particulary good here anyway.And ""Dumb Dog"" doesn't even count as a song. Although the song about the contract invovling Warbucks in Hannigan was comic, it too was dull.""Annie"" is perhaps the worst stage to screen musicals. How could they ruined this well-written masterpiece?"

767809254_6496	Reviews_movies_tv	This movie is wonderful for its simple story of life, enhanced by a rare combination of heavyweight talent.  The characters seem to jump off the screen because they are so homey and natural, and the deep philosophical thought into which so many movies of this type sink is almost completely absent, leaving something readily understandable and enjoyable that allows you to laugh or cry freely.It is unusual for so many famous stars to appear in one film.  Julia Roberts is listed after many of the other names, though today she is one of the most popular and highly paid actors in the world.  Sally Field plays Julia Roberts' fretful mother, always concerned about her daughter, but a balanced concern.  Julia is the marginally rebellious daughter, who thinks her mother fusses too much over her, wanting her mother to let her lead her own life.Much of the interaction in this movie takes place between Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine, Darryl Hannah and Sally Field.  The women gossip, criticize each other and support each other, the kind of love and friendship that seems to exist more often in smaller communities.  Dolly Parton is outgoing and friendly, as is Olympia Dukakis.  Shirley MacLaine is noisy and complains about everything, figuring that being old and wealthy allows her the right to complain.  Darryl Hannah is a very religious frumpy young woman with (gasp!) a past, though her past seems mild to many of us.  These women support each other and provide advice, but also an outlet for their wishes and hopes and problems.  They also often like to talk about each other, though in a way they try hard to be polite and supportive when they can.Some of the funniest scenes involve Tom Skerritt as Sally Field's husband Drum.  Tom seems to have a way of doing things that provide at least smiles, and a bit of eye rolling on occasion.  Tom is funniest when he interacts with Shirley MacLaine.  Tom seems to enjoy tormenting Shirley and Shirley enjoys griping back at Tom.  While on one level it appears that the two dislike each other, the viewer also must recognize that they could have avoided each other and yet do not, so surely they must get some enjoyment out of the encounters.The central character throughout the movie is Julia Roberts.  We discover early in the movie that she suffers from diabetes, and the effects are often severe.  The tension between Julia and Sally Field as Julia's symptoms and problems increase, and the tension with the rest of the women in the movie, increases during the movie, awaiting release.  The movie alternates between laughter and pain until near the ending that has its sad moments, but ends relatively happily as the true lesson of the movie is finally revealed.Stories of real life are often boring or are hard to comprehend because of lack of a common background.  This story of real life has enough caricature to be funny enough to keep your attention, while being sufficiently rooted in life to allow you to feel like this life could have been yours, your parents, or your grandparents.Some of the subject matter in this film makes it unsuitable for young members of the family.  (...)  However, I think this excellent film should be suitable for older children and all other family members.

But still, the level of entertainment and fantasy and horror we have in this film is FAR, VERY FAR from everything that got released in the last few years in terms of horror!!!... This film also marks the beginning of a very popular tendency to have an Heroine in the main role instead of a hero, it took a long time and a few flops but slowly, we began to see more women's  in the main role.

When the 4th one starts, they've already been released from the institution and are now living normal lives and are going to school...Kristen is the first one to start having nightmares about Freddy again  and about how he's not dead yet and might probably come back. Of course Joey and Kincaid think she's crazy as they thought they got rid of him during the 3rd film. But they will soon discover that they were wrong and that Freddy is about to come back haunting their nightmares until they are all dead!! Only this time, Freddy has a real opponent!!!.........Alice!!!.....Alice is a frequent  daydreamer and has the ability to control her dreams, but there is also something else...something strong...some kind of inner relation with Freddy himself.... Alice will also get the abilities, strength and special features that everyone that gets kill by Freddy, once he collected their soul after killing them, their abilities get transferred directly into Alice, making her a very powerful opponent for the final challenge!!!!!!The story may seem ordinary for some people but i believe it is a MUST SEE for everyone!!!! Special  and spooky effects are present through the whole Movie!!!!! The acting is good..very good!!..Nothing  cheesy or anything. Alice is a true heroine!!! A real character with awesome abilities!!! The dreams and nightmares in this movie are just totally crazy!!! Will sometimes make you feel like your on drugs...(even if your not...lol)...Definitely  beyond expectations and way better than any other Freddy Movies I've seen in everyway...and I've seen them all!!!!! The cinematography is unique and even though everything is digital now, the remastered version here is nothing but a dream for your eyes!!!! The soundtrack is amazing and portrays perfectly the 80's and their unique musical style, extremely diverse too!!!Overall, this is a movie you have to see!!! Alice is a real heroine in there and will please any horror/fantasy fans. She's part of my artistic culture, just like Carol Ann was in POLTERGEIST (Heather O Rourke).

078060718X_21354	Reviews_movies_tv	"There isn't much to save this movie. People are upset with its portrayal of a born-again Christian, but the hard, sad truth is, MANY people are like this. They live empty, shallow lives, get bored, turn around, preach to everybody, fall by the wayside, and wind up disillusioned with their new-found faith. And they wind up worse than before. Very typical.People call this a slap in the face of Christianity, due to its portrayal of a believer, but really, it hurls the slap in the direction of people who don't believe as Christians do. It is annoying. Annoying, also, is the boy's constant referral of the final book of the New Testament as ""the book of Revelations."" If you actually LOOK at the text, you'll see it's just called ""Revelation."" No ""S."" This irks me. A genuine sign of lack of comprehension, is adding a final ""S"" to titles that are written in the singular. I see it all the time. As I do here.And the writer of the film says War is the First Horseman. Actually, the leading horse is white, a false peace, leading up to war.But the general message of this film is, only a few of the billions of people on Earth will wind up in Paradise. God, in His infinite wisdom, keeps pumping more and more people into a corrupt, over-crowded world, hoping one day he might get it right, creating the same flawed beings over and over, but turning his back on them when they stumble.A disturbing thing in this film is, I believe, a very realistic depiction of the psychological abuse the youngsters experience at the hands of the pious. The born-again's roots are not deep enough to take hold, as per the parable in the Gospel, and the innocent pay. The psychobabble of the mother talking about God taking them, the mother and daughter, up to Heaven, to be with the husband, who is the girl's father, and being left to look like fools when it doesn't happen, which has ALWAYS been the case with stories of the Second Coming, are, of course, what are expected to happen here. The woman looked like Linus Van Pelt, in his annual camp-out in the pumpkin patch, awaiting the ""Great Pumpkin."" This has happened many, many times in the real world, and it leaves people with egg on their face every time.I think my biggest problem with this film is, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak. The doubters are seen as cynical, and the believers are seen as a secret society, and the main character is a bit of a loose cannon, who looks for God, can't find Him, suffers disappointment after disappointment, committing illegal, immoral acts along the way, and finally being taken to the gate of Heaven, just for God to say ""Nah, I don't think so,""  and leave her in the ""Outer Darkness"" to look in from the outside, forever.It's a propaganda film, and a bad one, at that.A little post-script, many weeks after writing this review: I would like to know what's so ""not helpful"" about the above review. I tell in it why I didn't like the movie. Maybe because I have criticized ""Christians"" as being pious and lacking in reading and comprehension skills?"

783241313_53296	Reviews_movies_tv	"I remember hearing about this movie when it came out around 1999, it was around the time I was beginning to buy DVDs of some movies I liked (I paid 44$CAN for my first DVD ever, ""Tomorrow Never Dies""). I didn't knew it was a Milos Forman movie so I wasn't even interested, I tought that the picture on the cover looked somewhat ridiculous. It was after I rented the movie ""The Peoples VS Larry Flynt"" that I decided to see it, since the two movies were written by the same writers and directed by Milos Forman, so I figured it would be another classic. It turned out to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, it have been so horribly mangled that the ""Milos Forman"" touch is not even present at all... As far as I'm concerned there's so much holes and continuity errors in the story that seeing it is a complete waste of time, I wouldn't call this a good memorial to Andy Kaufman's legacy, it would be more of an insult... I believe that since Milos Forman named his two latest childrens Andrew and Jim in honor of Andy Kaufman, my opinion is that there was a misunderstanding regarding the real Tony Clifton, who is apparently still alive and played himself uncredited in this movie. In any case a few years ago around 2008 I read the original script I found on the internet, with some imagination it give a glimpse of how it was intended to be originally, and it's easy to see it would have been of the same quality as the movie ""The Peoples VS Larry Flynt"", a ""10"" out of ""10"". Among other things, there was supposed to be a scene where Andy Kaufman is robbed after going out of the nightclub where he met his manager George Shapiro, and he act with the burglars as if he was on stage acting. A awful lot of other changes like that were made, probably during the editing process where they put the movie together... I don't know if the original parts were filmed or still exist, maybe it would be possible to ""re-edit"" the movie in the future so it would be as intended originally... It should be noted that either Milos Forman, Jim Carrey or the writers Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander worked seriously after that movie was made, Jim Carrey seem to work just for the fun of it and he do what he want..."

780021045_18982	Reviews_movies_tv	Few philosophers are renowned for their guidance in military tactics or their competence as men of the battlefield. Considering that such men excel in the art of brutal killing, they seem an odd category of people to recommend to the masses the right methods of life. A large part of the population have for long wisdom of such men, Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli and Sun Tzu springing readily to mind, as they are seen as playing the devil's advocate for the cruel rulers they guide. However demented or wise these men may be, they without doubt shaped the political and social structure of their government and their influence has carried on even to our era. Among such men, the case of the protagonist of Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is an unusual one; a ronin-a samurai without a Lord or House to serve-as the political and military philosopher. His text on military strategy, The Book of Five Rings, is still being read and scrutinized in many areas, from philosophy to business.A famed swordsman, Musashi Miyamoto, was an unbeatable warrior whose legacy carries on as one of the most rebellious and intriguing men of his time. Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is the first segment of a trilogy of films depicting Musashi's life; as it is the first segment it focuses on his early exploits to become a samurai. Following the loss of his side at the Battle of Sekigahara, he takes refugee with his fellow friend, Honiden Matahachi, at the house of a widow and her daughter. The daughter and widow fall in love with Musashi due to his swordsmanship that kills, injures, and scares of a large portion of the ronin that demands favors such as money, food, jewelry-especially Gold-to leave them unharmed. He rejects both women while Matahachi attaches himself to the women, even though he has promised to return to his faithful fianc&eacute;. Angered by this event, Musashi returns to his village to inform Matahachi's mother and fianc&eacute; of his whereabouts.As in many other classic Samurai films,  Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto contains great acting, by the likes of no other than Toshiro Mifune, an able director, and carefully chosen settings. Even with all the good performances and genuinely fine screenplay, based on a contemporary Japanese novel of Musashi's life, the film is ultimately forgettable. Undeniably, the film simply aims at describing Musashi's earliest years, but in turn creates a work that could only interest fans of Musashi Myamoto rather than the average filmgoer. What really drains the film is the lack of comprehension of Musashi's true talent and vigor; on the surface he seems indistinguishable from countless samurai of other samurai flicks. Granted that he may be a shallow samurai, no insight or philosophy is assigned to character. It is quite unexplained why he hates the village and its inhabitants as much as he does. Without some insight about the true significance of Musashi, the audience of the film will be more confused at the significance of this character that seems to lack any significant characteristic worth caring for.Strangely, the film succeeds in making Musashi look like a complete loon and fool, and not a believable one. In the hunt that ensues, he succeeds in overpowering nearly everyone, but surrenders himself to the Priest with no opposition; it is not the surrender that is strange, but the method of surrender which is so spiritless and uncharacteristic of the samurai character that Musashi so eagerly demands to achieve. If that wasn't enough, Musashi is deceived a second time by the Priest who caused him so much suffering and humiliation. Unfortunately, the story line may be believable and acceptable in the novel that the film is based on, but many of the film's developments seem to embarrassingly display the filmmaker's inability of giving the work an acceptable ending.Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto is insignificant not because Musashi's himself is not interesting for the contemporary viewer, far from it, but because he is utterly identical to every other samurai you have seen. As it is shown, he is a great swordsman, but, then again, are not all samurai? As much as Toshiro Mifune attempts to show us the rebellious, and eventual moral character, of Musashi we are at a loss, because the script is so thinly developed that even the noblest efforts of the entire cast combined can not make the film the great picture that it truly deserves to be. Surprisingly, Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto was presented with Academy  Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 28th (1955) Oscars; however, odd a selection this may be, it is not nearly as strange why the following two segment of the trilogy were devoid of such honors.

783243499_54848	Reviews_movies_tv	I'd never cared for Ellis' books before, and I never read the novel this movie is based on, but I found myself watching this in a hotel room and got drawn in.  This is a seriously warped movie, much more disturbing than any teenybopper slasher flick. Nothing is more intentionally perverse than the scenes in which the protagonist soliloquizes about his favorite music-- horrible, commercial stuff like Whitney Houston, Robert Palmer, and Huey Lewis-- I guess as a comment on the shallowness of the 80's commercial culture Ellis was satirizing.  That scene where he calls &quot;The greatest love of all&quot; one of the most beautiful songs ever written completely without irony...well, there's more to this movie that will turn your stomach.  Not for the squeamish.  I don't care for gore much myself, but this is a good movie that effectively explores all manners of disturbing behavior and thought.  Only complaint:  the ending of the movie makes less sense than Fight Club's ending did.  See it if you wanna get creeped out.

780626699_27028	Reviews_movies_tv	"The Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection includes 9 different movies.  These are not his nine best, but several are, and most  rank near the top of his legendary career.  Here are the reviews for the each movie:NORTH BY NORTHWESTNorth by Northwest is a timeless classic involving action, adventure, drama, suspense and even some well-timed comedy, all rooted from a simple case of mistaken identity. Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive, who is accidentally mistaken for a secret government agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill's main adversary is a spy for a foreign government named Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Along the way, Thornhill meets a beautiful blond named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who adds a lot of sex appeal along with several surprises to this wild and wonderful plot.The movie is masterpiece for numerous reasons. The first reason is because of the some of the unforgettable action shots including Grant being attacked by a crop dusting plane in a remote cornfield and then being chased across the face of Mount Rushmore. But beyond just the action, there many brilliant scenes where Grant either alludes the people tracking him or simply just outsmarts them and does some impressive detective work on his own. The script oozes with witty and clever lines with many visually memorable scenes as well. Another strength of the movie is a powerful music score that accentuates every crucial moment in the film. Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best. The movie also breaks out of the old Hollywood overly restrained romance situations with some very forward dialogue and some sexually suggestive scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (but still extremely tame by today's standards). Finally, the widescreen color presentation is nothing short of spectacular. Not only is this Hitchcock's best, but from my personal viewpoint, it ranks #4 on my list of the greatest movies ever made behind Casablanca and The Godfather I & II. I have watched this movie at least six times over the past 25 years (now for the first time on DVD) and it still hasn't lost its edge.As mentioned, the DVD quality is utterly fantastic for a film this old. The widescreen color transfer is completely immaculate, and rich in color and sharpness - rivaling movies made today. The sound is also outstanding for a film this old. There many bonuses, but the best is the making of the film with a cross the country diary of how and where the movie was shot. There is also a very good commentary by the Earnest Lehman who wrote the screenplay.Movie: A+DVD Quality: A+SUSPICIONThe movie opens on train where Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) sits down in a private first class compartment with a frumpy young woman named Lina (Joan Fontaine). Johnnie makes an excuse that he was in another first class car but couldn't stand the smoke. When the conductor collects the tickets, he finds that Johnnie doesn't have a first class ticket or enough money to cover the difference in fare. With some slick salesmanship, Johnnie gets Lina to pay the additional fare. This is a foreshadowing of things to come. They meet again and have a whirlwind romance and get married. Lida quickly finds out that Johnnie has champaign tastes on a beer drinker's budget and uses a lot of charm and shrewd chicanery to obtain money without doing an honest day's work. As time goes on, Lida losses trust in Johnnie but later develops legitimate fears that he may go as far as committing murder for financial gain. This sets up the remainder of the film with plenty of suspense and drama finding out who the real Johnnie is and how far he'll go with his money scheming shenanigans.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for many reasons, but mainly because of the two leading actors: Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Not only were their individual performances terrific, but also the chemistry between the two was astounding. The Johnnie Aysgarth character was a spellbinding enigma throughout the entire film. Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directed the acting so that it was hard to tell if Johnnie was a charming, but irresponsible child in a man's body or deadly sociopath. Joan Fontaine won an Oscar for her performance as the emotionally tortured wife. Nigel Bruce also did a great job in a supporting role as Johnnie's old friend 'Beaky'. Another wonderful thing about this movie is that there is a clear comical element to the film - especially when Johnnie assumes that his newly wedded wife has lots of money but finds out she doesn't. The way Johnnie wiggles his way out several tight spots is a fascinating display of his creative and spontaneous ingenuity. All in all, it's a terrific suspense film with virtually no wasted moments in the entire movie. The ending is slightly controversial only because we find out in the commentary that the ending was change at the last minute. Some people would have undoubtedly preferred the original ending. I'm fine with the released version.The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, with only a few grainy scenes. The sound was fine and DVD includes a bonus commentary segment about ""Suspicion"".Movie: ADVD Quality: ASTAGE FRIGHTThe movie 'Stage Fright' opens with Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) and Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) fleeing London in a car. As they are driving off eluding the police, Jonathon tells Eve of the mess that he's in. His story in a nutshell is that a famous actress named Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) killed her husband in their home and splattered blood on her dress and came to Jonathon's apartment for help. Jonathon explains that he ended up going back to the murder scene to get Charlotte a clean dress but was seen, thus making him the primary suspect. From this point on Eve does a number of things to protect and exonerate him including working as an operative so that she can find evidence to convict Charlotte of the murder.The film uses some shameless chicanery to misdirect the audience. To avoid spoiling the plot, my problem wasn't so much that a subterfuge was used, but that it carried on this charade for just about the entire movie (until the final few minutes of the film). But that wasn't the biggest flaw for me. My bigger problem with the film is that its obvious that Jonathan is grossly infatuated or in love with Charlotte, and this becomes crystal clear to Eve, yet she still does everything possible to help him get out of this mess. Another significant problem is that Eve, who lives in London and has British parents speaks with an American accent except when she's a spy.But in spite of these problems, Marlene Dietrich gives a mesmerizing performance that's truly Oscar-worthy. Even beyond her radiant beauty, she exudes confidence and poise in every scene she's in. Alastair Sim, who plays Eve's father in a supporting role, gives a very witty and extremely entertaining performance. If you get past the American accent, Jane Wyman does a decent job too. The movie is still very entertaining and fun to watch - again mainly due to Marlene Dietrich.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp but the presentation is marred by specs of film deterioration throughout the film. Sadly, a severe vertical scratch appearing for at least 6 or 7 seconds severely distracts the final scene of the movie. The sound was good for a film this old. The only worthwhile bonus on the DVD is a short commentary about the film `Stage Fright'.Movie: B+DVD Quality: BDIAL M FOR MURDERThe movie 'Dial ""M"" for Murder' is film adapted from a successful play. Alfred Hitchcock directed this picture and since almost all of the movie takes place in one setting, it really does have the look of a play put on film. But that does not in anyway denegrate the quality nor entertainment value of this movie. On the contrary, because of a brilliantly conceived story, coupled with superb acting, the film is terrific.The story is set in London and involves a love triangle between a retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), his wealthy and beautiful wife Margot (Grace Kelly), and an American novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Halliday returns to London after an extended absence and Tony knows about this affair and concocts a brilliant plot to murder his wife. He develops what seems like a perfect murder plan by blackmailing an old college friend Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson), into committing the murder so that Tony has a perfect alibi. This sets up the remainder of the film where a death occurs and an investigation is opened by the police, and Tony, Halliday and the police detectives match wits figuring out what really happened.The film is rather simple in format and even though there are several twists, the real magic of the movie is how well Tony Wendice, Halliday and the police intellectually involve themselves in the murder plot. Another major strength of the movie is the performance of Ray Milland, who plays a smooth, charming and very cunning mastermind of what seems like the perfect murder. His cool compsure from beginning to end in all sorts of troubled spots is an amazing sight to watch. When he confronts Swann with his plan, Swann seems like a trapped animal and appears to have no choice to commit the crime since Wendice has him between a rock and a hard spot. But the murder seems so well thought out that the risks appear to be minimal. Once the police are involved, Chief Inspector Hubbard played by John Williams shines as well with superb detective work figuring out how and why this killing really occurred. Grace Kelly also does a fine acting job in this film. Overall, its a great movie, but clearly a lesser challenging film for Hitchcock's cinematic brilliance. This was originally filmed in 3-D, so the movie exploits a lot of foreground/background subjects instead of showing characters and props mostly equal distant to the camera.The DVD transfer is top notch. There is virtually no film deterioration present and the full-screen color is vibrant. The sharpness is very good, but not great and there were a few times some of the subjects seems out of focus, but that's probably attributed to the 3-D technology of that era. Overall, its still an excellent visual presentation of the movie. The sound was fine also. The extras include a short documentary analysis of the film plus a very short segment on the history of 3-D.Movie: ADVD Quality: AI CONFESSI've been a big fan of Hitchcock since I saw the movie ""The Birds"" in the late 1960's and since then I thought I'd seen all of his movies on either video, TV or the big screen at some movie festivals. I recently bought the nine DVD ""Signature Collection"" and had seen all but two movies, one of which was ""I Confess"". I really didn't know what to expect and was a bit disturbed with the artwork which shows a priest holding a beautiful woman.The storyline involves an immigrant named Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse) who works as a maintenance man in a Catholic Church in Quebec. One night Otto comes into the cathedral and sees a priest named Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) and asks the priest hear his confessions. Otto confesses to Father Logan that he killed someone earlier that night. Father Logan goes to that house of the murdered man the following morning, but the police have already arrived and Logan also runs into Ruth Grandfort (Ann Baxter), a woman he knows. The police have only one lead and it appears that some witnesses saw a priest leave the scene of the crime. The plot thickens intensely as Father Logan becomes a primary suspect, and his credibility is challenged since he appears to be involved with a married woman yet because of his oath as a priest, he cannot divulge the confessions of the killer. This sets up the rest of the movie for plenty drama and suspense.This was one of those movies that sticks with you long after you watch it and gives you a lot to think about. There could be many parallels made to the life of Jesus who served and sacrificed his life for the sake of the sinners of the world (although Father Logan is in no way a Messiah). Other allegories include being ridiculed and scorned for acts he never committed or for being compassionate and forgiving for those who've harmed him. In all, its a story of compassion, sacrifice and love, but perhaps most of all staying true to your oath and calling, even in the face of death. The acting was nothing extra special, but I would say Karl Maldon was the best of the bunch. The script was superb and the picture certainly had that ""Hitchcock look"", especially in the opening segment at night. In case anyone cares, I'm not a Roman Catholic, but a Christian who attends a protestant church, yet I found this movie very inspiring. It was also refreshing to see a movie that wasn't trying to viciously scandalize the church as many movies do today. This film may be more for acquired tastes, but for myself, I was thoroughly pleased with the story, and was more challenged than entertained.The DVD quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old. The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, but seemed a tad grainy in some scenes. The sound was fine and there were a few bonus features including a commentary segment about ""I Confess"".Movie: ADVD Quality: A-FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTThe story takes place in the late 1930's where an American newspaper reporter named Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is assigned to go to Europe to report on the possibility of a pending global war. His editor emphasizes that he doesn't want correspondence - he wants news. So Jones goes first to England and later to Holland where he witnesses an apparent assassination of a Dutch diplomat. This starts the beginning of a wild and dangerous investigation where Jones tries to uncover all the details and people responsible for this incident.There are several things that I liked about this movie. The settings in Europe, especially the windmills in Holland, made a great backdrop to a very good plot. The underlying theme of foreign espionage with several surprising twists was also a major asset to the film. The acting was excellent and so was the cinematography. My only minor turnoff with the film was the noticeable complacency of the characters in very life threatening situations. Overall, it was an extremely relevant film, especially considering it was released shortly before America entered World War II. For me it was a very good movie but not a great one.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp and crisp but the film was clearly un-restored due to tiny specs of film deterioration showing up sporadically throughout the movie. The sound was very satisfactory. The only bonuses on the DVD include a trailer and a short feature entitled ""Foreign Hitchcock"".Movie: B+DVD Quality: BSTRANGERS ON A TRAIN'Strangers on a Train' is Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie and certainly one of his better ones. The storyline involves a young tennis player named Guy Haines (Farley Granger), who sits with another man named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a several hour train ride. Guy is somewhat of a celebrity and Bruno seems to know a lot about his turbulent personal life. At one point Bruno proposes a scheme where he could murder Guy's estranged wife in exchange for murdering Bruno's tyrannical and wealthy father. The plot appears foolproof since the each murderer in theory would be nearly impossible to track down. Guy is greatly disturbed by this proposal, yet through Bruno's distorted perspective, he seems convinced that the agreement to this devious plot is mutual. Not too long after this meeting, Bruno tracks down Guy's separated wife and murders her and reveals his so called end of the bargain to Guy. This sets up the remainder of the movie where Guy is put in a very precarious position by not only the police who view him as the primary suspect, but from Bruno who expects Guy to perform his end of the deal.This movie is a lot of fun, mainly because Robert Walker does such an outstanding job as this devious sociopathic killer. His performance as the cool and calculated murderer masked by his wealthy, refined and well-educated appearance is extraordinary. His persistence of involving himself by in effect blackmailing and stalking his pseudo partner is also well done. Another fine performance is by Marion Lorne who plays Bruno's mother. Her naivet&eacute; and constant denial of her son's clear psychological problems is a real treasure to watch. There is also some terrific camera work in this movie, clearly due to the creative genius of Alfred Hitchcock. I was slightly unimpressed with the ending, but overall, its a very entertaining movie.The DVD quality is a pristine full screen B&W; transfer. The contrast and sharpness are superb for a movie this old. The DVD comes with plenty of bonuses including a second ""preview"" version of the film and lots of commentaries and documentaries.Movie: A-DVD Quality: ATHE WRONG MANThis movie is in effect a real life documentary of man being arrested and tried for crimes he did not commit. Henry Fonda stars as Manny Balestrero, a New York nightclub bass player who is arrested for a series of armed robberies. Balestrero has a wife named Rose (Vera Miles) and two sons, so his surprise arrest puts a huge financial and emotional burden on this family. The movie is very detailed as it goes through the entire legal process of his interrogation, arrest, arraignment, legal counseling and finally his trial.This is a very serious movie and it's a clear departure from other mid-50's Hitchcock American films. The movie is shot in full-screen black and white, and has a very noir-type look. The soundtrack also doesn't sound like it's from a studio orchestra but rather a jazz band with it's very prominent score as opposed to being just background music. I liked the movie, but didn't love it. It seemed like Hitchcock went through the motions on this one but it does have a very strong ending. Overall, the film is emotionally draining and uses very little artistic creativity, but it's obvious that Hitchcock did not intend to entertain his audience but rather send a sobering message regarding how fragile life is. To it's credit, the film also reveals a message of divine intervention when we turn to God in our time of deepest pain.The DVD transfer very sharp but some tiny deterioration was noticeable periodically throughout the film. The sound is excellent as the music soundtrack sets an important tone to the movie. The extras include a short documentary analysis of the film.Movie: BDVD Quality: B+MR. & MRS. SMITHThis was Hitchcock's first and last attempt of directing a comedy. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is a comical farce about a married couple named Anne (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) who clearly have some relationship issues since Anne has an established pattern of spending days at a time in bed anytime she has a disagreement with her husband. After making up from their latest tiff, Anne asks David, ""If given the chance to go back in time would you marry me again""? His instant response is ""No"", but then realizes he's made a terrible gaff and unsuccessfully tries to cover his tracks, but at least does enough damage control to keep them together. Shortly after David learns that through a legal snafu, their marriage is void. When Anne learns about this legal wrinkle, she separates and this sets up a cat and mouse game between the two seeing if they can salvage their relationship.As much as I like Hitchcock and Carole Lombard, both Hollywood legends in their own right, I can't say this movie worked magic for me. I do know that films like this were very popular in their day, but I didn't find any of it laugh-out-loud funny, although some of scenes put a smile on my face. I did like the slice of life look of the film as it showed many interesting backdrops including several original interior shots plus scenes at an amusement park and a ski resort. If you like screwball comedies from this era, you will probably be very entertained with the film. If you don't like that type of humor, or hope to find lots of Hitchcock's creative artistry and cinematic brilliance, you will probably be disappointed with the film.The B&W; picture quality of this DVD is sharp and crisp but tiny specs of film deterioration showed up sporadically throughout the movie. The sound was very satisfactory for a film this old. The only bonus on the DVD is a short commentary about the film.Movie: CDVD Quality: B+"	Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best.	74:78	1534:1538	Mr &amp; Mrs Smith VHS		best		performance, OF=Grant & Mason, ENVIRONMENT=Mr & Mrs Smith	performances, OF=Grant & Mason, ENVIRONMENT=movies	#0=performances	quality	positive	y		
783230427_48229	Reviews_movies_tv	&quot;. . . Seeist thou as man sees?&quot;These questions are asked in the Book of Proverbs and in John Carpenter's Village of the Damned, a remake of director Wolf Rilla's 1960 version, both adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos.Village of the Damned is the story of the simultaneous births of telepathic children to every woman of child-bearing age in the coastal village of Midwich, California.  Carpenter's version is more bloody than the version set in Midwich, England, starring George Sanders (but, like many of Carpenter's movies, not as bloody as people think).Carpenter's remake is more hopeful.  Maybe the filmmakers wanted to leave the story open for a sequel, or maybe the survival of one of the children without his extraterrestrial mate is meant to show the possibility of union between the two inimical species.  (&quot;Are we to pity you?&quot; asks Mara, daughter of the town doctor and leader of the alien children, as she explains the facts of cosmic evolution to her father.)The woman quoting Proverbs is the wife of the minister killed by the children before he can shoot their leader.  The minister's wife leads torch-bearing villagers who might have come from a forties Universal horror film.  Though put to the children, the question (Are you human?) is also directed at the other villagers and at us.This Village of the Damned begins with the same deliberate pacing of the original film, a mark of British horror.  Something passes over Midwich and everyone blacks out for six hours.  Not everyone wakes up.If there's a theme it's what duty parents owe their children.  Children often seem like alien monsters even when they weren't conceived in a blackout by an interstellar cloud.  Children demand food and education about the world and ultimately they demand that their parents step aside - -  die - -  for them to inherit it.Here there are good reasons for parents to feel uneasy about their soon-to-be-born offspring - -  some women are virgins or have been separated from their husbands so the children couldn't have been conceived normally.  But none of the parents reject the children for that reason.The mothers have no choice.  After the mass conceptions they all have dreams of  carrying their babies to term - -  the first telepathic action of the childrens' group mind.  The men accept the children, too.  The angriest husband, who's been away for months, at first leaves his wife, but then joins her in the huge delivery room where all the children are born on the same night.After the children are born the adults, even their parents, aren't safe.  The childrens' urge to survive and the knowledge that one species or the other will dominate causes them to play on the emotional bond that exists for the parents, especially the mothers, without being hampered by it themselves.  This isn't much different than the biological adaptation normal infants have acquired to ensure their survival.  David is the exception, the one whose ties to the group mind are weakest.One of the children was stillborn and taken away by a government scientist (or was it?).  She was to be David's partner.  Mara tells David that his lack of a mate does make him less valuable to the group.  As the children realize they have to escape the town and their parents' control - -  grow up - -  the town doctor, Mara's father, has the opportunity (and therefore the responsiblility) to try to save humanity.  David, too, makes a choice.Parents, especially ones with green-eyed children, might have some disturbing thoughts after watching this movie.

767809254_6479	Reviews_movies_tv	An extremely episodic story of several smalltown southern women whose social lives revolve around meetings in the local beauty parlor, STEEL MAGNOLIAS' script and performances are dogged by an aura of artificiality--but it scarcely matters, for the film is a tremendous amount of fun.Some of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective); Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun.  Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.The script abounds in zinging one-liners (&quot;If you can't say something nice, come sit by me!&quot;) and often hilarious situations (imagine Olympia Dukakis surrounded by naked men in the highschool football team's locker room); it also contains some very touching segments sure to choke up all but the most heartless viewer. And although the story is extremely manipulative and rather predictable, those factors don't actually get in the way of its effectiveness.  While probably not a &quot;great film&quot; by any serious standard, it is tremendously good-natured, well-intended, and extremely entertaining, and most people will find that it lingers pleasantly in mind and holds up well under repeated viewings.

780023161_21112	Reviews_movies_tv	"Criterion notwithstanding, this collection of three movies directed by Jean Cocteau is no trilogy. Rather the three works represent three quite different views of the Poet-the prototypic artistic creator for Cocteau--at three different moments in his career. The first, Blood of a Poet (1930) released at the same time as L'Age d'Or of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali-both pictures were financed by the wealthy patron of the arts, the Vicomte de Noailles-is the most ""Orphic"" of three, and like L'Age d'Or very much in the vein of French experimental films of the 1920s, with an abundance of symbolism and rejection of conventional narrative syntax. Less radically innovative than L'Age d'Or, Blood of a Poet is like a brilliant book of sketches, some of which work, some of which don't.Cocteau made no films for over a decade, and only returned to the cinema during the Occupation with The Eternal Return, for which he wrote the screenplay. Although directed by Jean Delannoy, the film was clearly Cocteau's own creation, and marked both the beginning of a period of fertile cinematic collaboration with Jean Marais and a new phase in Cocteau's contributions to film. The masterpiece of this period is, of course, Orpheus (1949). Cocteau had begun in Blood of a Poet by radically breaking with realism. Now he set about showing how the images of modern life could be invested with a mythic power of their own.In The Eternal Return, Cocteau had put the story of Tristan and Yseult into a modern setting, but without the least hint of irony. In updating the myth of Orpheus to post-World War II Paris, however, he adopted a very different strategy. The Thracian singer becomes a rich and famous writer (Jean Marais) who supplies exactly what the public looks for in literature. At the beginning of the film, Orpheus boasts to an older retired writer, ""The public loves me!"" And the latter tartly retorts, ""The public is alone."" But as a result of the unforeseen adventure he lives through in the film, an adventure in which he confronts and falls in love with his own Death (Maria Casares), Orpheus momentarily becomes the Poet he never has been.Cocteau had placed the myth of the sacrifice of the Poet at the center of Blood of a Poet, and he explicitly articulates it in Orpheus: ""The death of a poet requires a sacrifice to make him immortal."" However, the ""real"" Poet, from this point of view, is not Orpheus-who goes back to happily settle down in bourgeois bliss with his expectant wife-but Cegeste (Edouard Dermithe), who becomes the servant of Death, and unquestioningly transmits the messages from the underworld (read: the unconscious). The Poet has to sacrifice himself in order to be more than a writer-""A writer without being a writer,"" is how he defines the poetic vocation before the Judges of the Underworld-but Orpheus will never have the courage to make that choice by himself.Not the least astounding thing about Orpheus is the assurance with which Cocteau handles the machinery of commercial film production. Orpheus is hardly a mainstream production by American standards, but it has no ragged edges, technically speaking. The film was strikingly photographed by Nicolas Hayer and it makes a highly adroit use of special effects shots, whose primitive magic Cocteau understood and employed quite effectively. The musical score is by Georges Auric, a member of Les Six who has to rank with Bernard Herrman as one of the major composers of film music in the history of motion pictures. Last but not least, Orpheus has a formidable cast, including-in addition to Jean Marais-Franois Perier as Heurtebise, Maria Dea as Eurydice, Juliette Greco as her friend Aglaonice, Roger Blin as the older poet, and the sublime Maria Casares as the most glamorous personification of Death ever to appear on the screen.Viewers will likely have the most difficulty getting into the third movie, The Testament of Orpheus. Cocteau's adieu to the screen is a work filled with spontaneity and invention, so impulsively unstructured as to make Blood of a Poet look like Racinian tragedy. Cocteau plays a traveler lost in time who goes in search of Pallas Athene, but this is a mere pretext for stringing together a series of adventures, like the narrative premise of a picaresque novel. Testament of Orpheus was a movie ahead of its time when it came out 1959, and it remains so today. Possibly its release in DVD may serve to make it known to a wider audience.Criterion has done itself proud with this set. Anyone inclined to balk might consider that three DVDs of this quality at the price are already a bargain. The picture and sound quality of all three movies, each of which has been digitally remastered, is superb. Blood of a Poet was especially impressive in this respect, and I felt as if I were seeing it for the first time. In addition, The Orphic Trilogy includes a wealth of supplementary material such as essays and pronouncements by Cocteau.The set also contains two other films en marge of a non-fictional variety. One of these is Villa Santo Sospir, a 16mm picture about the home of Cocteau's neighbor on the Riviera, Mme. Alec Weisweiller, which he had extensively decorated. Mainly a record of art works, Villa Santo Sospir is his only extended work in color. The other, far more interesting, is a documentary about Cocteau's life entitled Autobiography of an Unknown by Edoardo Cozarinsky. Unfortunately, the picture quality is often dupey and unsatisfactory, but the film provides a number of invaluable interviews from the later phase of Cocteau's career.Anyone who enjoys The Orphic Trilogy should definitely consider purchasing the Criterion DVD of Beauty and the Beast, and the videotapes of The Eternal Return, The Storm Within (Les Parents terribles), and The Strange Ones (Les Enfants terribles), all available from Amazon.com."

767819462_10853	Reviews_movies_tv	This movie is a tough one to watch because many of the scenes (especially during the first hour) are riddled with tension -- the kind you feel when you've just confronted someone head-on.  Everyone fights  -- parents,  children, ex-wife and girlfriend, stepmother and children; you almost feel  like you've been inadvertantly caught with a friend when she decides to  have a major argument with a family member  -- makes you want to slip out  of the room until the storm is over.Chris Columbus did a wonderful job  directing this film -- the arguments were uncomfortable, but they were  supposed to be.  Better, there were some poignant moments that really  worked.  STEPMOM is a realistic fable with just a touch of magic to make  the audience happy.The cast was superb -- Julia Roberts and Susan  Sarandon gave great performances, and the kids (not sure of their names)  were both adorable and the biggest brats you've ever seen -- a great  combination.  Ed Harris was curiously absent from the film, showing up in  less than half the scenes.This movie is everything a drama is supposed  to be: funny, moving, difficult, sad.  Chris Columbus captured some  beautiful moments, and some hard ones as well, making the audience better  for the journey.

780621638_23473	Reviews_movies_tv	Come in from the cold the tagline to 1997's The Winter Guest invites us, and viewers who accept this faint beckoning soon look on as the cast of this unique production from Scotland does just that in one singularly metaphorical fashion or another. This is a quiet movie that says little with the spoken word and yet still tells one of the most poignantly rich stories ever committed to film. The Winter Guest takes place all in one frozen winter day in a town in rural Scotland, and brings four intertwined vignettes together as it imparts its barely whispered and unforgettable tales. There is a grieving young widow's resistance to her mother's attempts to brings her out of her deep depression; there are two boys who skip school and retreat to the frozen seashore to hide out for the day in this the last winter of their already fleeting childhood; there are two elderly ladies who bravely stare back at death by traveling to funerals of people barely known to them; and there is an eccentric girl, Nita, who forces a boy she fancies---Alex, the son of the widow, Frances, played by Emma Thompson---to finally take notice of her via a playfully serious confrontation amid the ice-covered streets of the little town they share. The Winter Guest would simply never have been made in America, nor could it have been. It is a story that requires patience, sensitivity and insight into the human condition, and for the investment of all of these, returns the sort of intelligently psychological motion picture that is all but extinct in this decade.

783239408_51205	Reviews_movies_tv	American Beauty: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutesAmerican Beauty is Spacey at his best...again, but wait, there's more. This time, a team of actors and actresses that nearly show him up accompany Spacey. A true movie ensemble including Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley threaten to steal the spotlight.A seemingly typical suburban neighborhood gets an in-depth look beneath the shallow surface. An ordinary, financially well-to-do family is followed through the point of view of the father (extraordinary Kevin Spacey). He narrates his life and fills the audience in on all of his quirks, flaws, and limitations, as well as those of his wife (Annette Benning), and daughter (Thora Birch). These introductory moments in which Spacey reveals a side of his family that no one in the neighborhood dare discover are executed with a touch of comical ingenuity. To glance beyond this comical absurdity exposes a miserable, dysfunctional, household with no escape from their perpetual sorrows. When the movie is seen through this perspective, it loses its humor, but picks up a deeper, more real meaning. This double angle that persists throughout the movie is one of the elements that make this movie so brilliantly interesting. To reassess the movie allows the deeper, more serious meaning to become more prominent, but while watching in the moment, laughter is most likely to be the initial overwhelming response. The movie is incredibly unique in its entire concept. It is so clever, serious, and funny all in one. No other movie has risked implementing such an unlikely combination. The result is absolute, inarguable success.American Beauty deals with the true nature of life, attempting to enlighten its viewers, by doing so in a charming, eloquent manner, as opposed to shoving it down our throats. `What is beauty?' is the question that this movie raises. Is it found in a nice looking house, a good-natured person, a flower, a gorgeous woman, or is it more abstract than that? What if beauty was found in exceptional circumstances that cannot be reasonably accounted for, or what if it were merely in understanding? All of these ideas are aroused; none are straightforwardly answered, though one theory that seems to come across clearly is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Every moment of every scene enacted in American Beauty is done with such precision and vitality, that they all become memorable without exception. The characters are all well developed. More interestingly, each character is severely flawed, some more than others, but each is forced to account for these flaws. The character of Kevin Spacey, Lester Burnham is one of great complexity, as are most in the movie. Lester has just decided that he would like to do more with his pathetic life than laze around and remain to be pathetic for eternity. He revives a suppressed, vivacious identity that he soon embraces. With this new livelihood, comes a price. His wife and daughter who have grown exceedingly distant through the years are not ready to take on a whole new Lester Burnham.To say that American Beauty exhibited superb acting throughout would be a major understatement. Kevin Spacey was utterly astonishing in his ability to convey the character of Lester Burnham. Annette Benning as Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham was as she has never been seen before. In comparison to her flaky, overdone role in The Siege, she seemed to have undergone some sort of miraculous endowment of acting skill, as well as passion for her part. She worked beautifully with Spacey, as did the daughter, Thora Birch, and the rest of the crew. No one was really better than anyone else because each actor played his role with such grace and dignity that none can be considered second-rate. The rest of the credit is awarded to first-time feature film director Sam Mendes who envisioned the entire film. It was he who set the mood, worked on the unique camera angles, informed all of the actors of how there characters were to be projected, and it was he who incorporated all of the minute fine points into a giant masterpiece.No complaints can be made of the unblemished American Beauty. It deserves Oscar attention to the highest degree.

767805712_5813	Reviews_movies_tv	Gattaca's most haunting and beautiful scene is a love scene, shot through an upside down camera in room with transparent walls. In the metallic, clinical and angular world of this film physical love is unnatural. Sex is  an impulsive passionatte act and therefore not intune with the perfection  of an intelligent, balanced, stoic and ultimately robotic populace.  Afterall the person you're with could take a hair off your head, take it to  a shop down the street and see if you are a &quot;valid&quot; person.Vincent (Ethan Hawke) has never accepted the fact that because he was a  natural, faith birth, he could never persue his dream about going to  outerspace. He meets a &quot;valid&quot;, genetically perfect Jerome (Jude  Law) who despite the previlage of genetic perfection is paralysed.  &quot;There is no gene for fate&quot; Hawke observes in his moving  unintrusive narration. Jerome agrees to lend him is indentity, and in  return Vincent will help him maintain his affluent lifestyle. This switch,  along with a murder plot would be enough to make a decent thriller, but  Gattaca only use this to hook the audience. Both Hawke and Law give the  best performance of their careers in these roles. And although I could  praise Gattace as one of the best sceince-fiction films I've ever seen,  calling it sceince-fiction seems like a stretch.In the near future,  doctors will be able to extract the best possible child from a man and a  woman. As a doctor explains to the parents in this film, &quot;You could  concieve naturally a 1000 times and never get such result, this child is  you, simply the best of you&quot;. You can't argue with a line that, and  I'm sure given the opportunity, most parents would choose to have their  children disease free, but it would never stop there. How about physical  fitness, good looks, a high I.Q., wouldn't you want to give your children  all these things. It is that age old arguement of man playing God, what is  particularly tragic about it these days is its inevitability. You can't  stop scientist from creating alternative organs for transplant, and you  can't stop them trying to wipe out cancer gentically. Afterall these are  good things, paradoxically they will almost certainly be abused. Even in  the world of Gattace &quot;discrimination is illigal&quot;, but that  doesn't stop the firm from using a urine sample as their interview.  Sceince, humanity's great shining light will also be its downfall. Opposing  sceince is undoubtly bigotry, all you can do is watch as we drift into  Orwell's 1984.As you may have guessed, this is a deeply provocative  and timely film. It is also an intensly passionate one. In the history of  film music, only Ennio Morricone's music for 1986's The Mission can compare  with the emotional impact of Michael Nyman's score for Gattaca.  Periodically his lyrical, etheral, almost mournful score is played over  scenes making the film an emotional rollercoaster ride. There is a scene  played under Nyman's music where Vincent and his girlfriend Irene (Uma  Thurman) go to look at a field of Solar Cells. The Cells are the plants of  the future, when the sunshines they bloom. Although they are magnificent,  unlike the plants they don't need you to water them.Gattaca is a  magnificent and overlooked film. Essentially optimistic in its view that  determination can truimph over any genetic pre-conditioning, I think its is  actually more ambigious and wiser then its outcome suggests. It suggests  that you may have to leave this planet to escape the clinical prejudice.  But if you don't have a space ship to get on, then leaving can only mean  one thing. Suicide.	And although I could  praise Gattace as one of the best sceince-fiction films I've ever seen,  calling it sceince-fiction seems like a stretch.In the near future,  doctors will be able to extract the best possible child from a man and a  woman.	200:204	1409:1413	Gattaca		best		the best posible child	possible children FROM=a man ^ a woman	#0=children	quality	positive	n		
767834739_14924	Reviews_movies_tv	"I have been reading these reviews(mostly the 1 star reviews) and the thing i have noticed most is that people have this movie confused with a Zombie flick. It is not a ""Zombie"" movie and was not meant to compete with such films as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn"", ""Dead Alive"", etc, etc. It is a movie based on a video game that happened to have some of the enemies be zombies(just one of the many enemies in the game). I would have guessed that people would have been mad that Tyrant wasn't in the first film or that the ""Hunter"" has yet to be introduced.I have also read that people are mad that the movie didn't follow the game. Well if the movie followed the game to a T, then it would be no fun to watch b/c you would know everything that would happen.Think of this movie more as an action flick with a big budget, undead enemies, explosions, and one heck of a cool setting(Raccoon City). Overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch. Don't get too technical on it and don't try to find faults or differences from the video game. If you do, you won't like it.I rated this 5 stars b/c i am a huge fan of the video games and i think the directors for both movies did a wonderful job of capturing the ""Resident Evil"" vibe on the big screen. It's a lot to have on your plate to take one of the biggest selling video games and turn it into a movie.So if you want to watch a great action flick, buy the Dvd. If you want to be a little whiny baby and pick apart the flaws, then right a 1 star review and go to your room to suck your thumb."

Pat Conroy, the books author is a genius in his telling of the southern tale of Tom Wingo, and his New York City romance  with psychiatrist Susan Lowenstien.  Nick Nolte is by far, the best actor  to come out of Hollywood in decades.  This man could have played Rhett  Butler.  Maybe it's because of my love for my native South Carolina, and  the romance I see in New York City, that attracts me to this movie, which I  have watched close to a dozen times.Barbra Striesand is excellant as  Susan Lowenstien, and her son (by Elliot Gould), who plays Bernard does a  great job as well.I enjoy just about every aspect of this film, the  intro, the flashbacks, the south in the summer, all of it!  Though the  South Carolina scenes were filmed in the coastal town of Beaufort,  according to Conroy's book Tom &amp; Sally actually reside on Sullivan's  Island, just outside of Charleston.  This area is the most gracious and  beautiful on the planet.  Maybe it's because I come from South Carolina.Favorite Scene:  The Shrimp Boat shown after Tom and his children go  shrimping with Tom's father, Henry.Note:  The movie could sure have  bettered itself by cutting down on the overuse of language, in my opinion.GOD BLESS !Kris Butts	With one word.....superb!This is, without a doubt, the greatest motion picture I have ever seen!

He wants us to forget about the ordinary rules of reality, to accept what we see as real, as would a young child. Basically, he's telling us to fasten our seatbelts, because the movie is going to take off and never come back down.There are movies, and then there are movies. This is a movie buff's movie, one for the ages. Why? Well, for starters, it was a miracle that this movie was ever made at all. If you check out the story behind its creation, you'll discover that because it was made right after World War IIa lot of the equipment used in it's production was in terrible shape. There was barely enough money to finish the movie. And people kept on stealing things from the set. Yet...this movie is perfect. The visuals literally will take your breath away. The acting will forever set the standard for any foreign film I will see in the future. And then there is...The Special EffectsThis movie without a doubt has the best special effects of any movie ever made. What do I mean? How about living furnature? Not inpressed? How about teleportation that ends in someone coming OUT of a wall? How about someone GLIDING across a floor? And let's not forget tears that turn into diamonds.

As a wife and mother dying slowly, agonizingly of cancer, she turns in her by now expected superb performance; even so, there are scenes that amaze. When Streep, whose entire identity has been formed around her skills at running a household, instructs daughter Renee Zellweger on how to have a wedding that she will never have the chance to organize or preside over, her words, delivered without an ounce of false sentiment, will draw tears from the hardest-hearted viewer.The film is fortunate to have Streep on hand, as she does much to alleviate weaknesses elsewhere. The structure and tone of Quindlen's book has been somewhat altered, not to its advantage. Hurt, playing the philandering father, comes off as more of a weakling and charlatan in the film script, thus skewing the emotional balance toward the women in the family. The mystery of whether someone in the family committed a mercy killing is clumsily handled, dealt with in segments showing Zellweger being interviewed by a police official that interrupt the flow of the drama. Finally, Zellweger herself, though sympathetic and a worthy foil for Streep, is not altogether convincing as a driven career woman. Still, the underlying truths about life, death and family, as brought forth by Meryl Streep's luminous performance, make this a drama worth savoring.

076780192X_3551	Reviews_movies_tv	"Between autumn 1975, after Jaws had become such a, excuse the pun, monster hit the previous summer, and November 1977, when Close Encounters finally opened, it held the distinction of being the most eagerly awaited movie since Gone with the Wind. Alas, it didn't turn out to be the attraction for the ages that so many people, myself included, had hoped. That said, it does deliver a terrific amount of entertainment value.The title refers to a phrase invented by science author J. Allan Hynek (who shows up in a cameo role) to describe three potential interactions between humans and alien life forms. The first involves a sighting, the second produces physical evidence, and the third results in some sort of contact.In this story, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an Indiana electric utility company worker and family man, experiences a close encounter of the first kind one night while investigating a power outage. He sees something extraordinary that scares the wits out of him and also leaves him with an encounter of the second kind (a partial sunburn) and disturbs him so severely that it eventually estranges his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) and his children. But the episode also endears him to Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a similarly tormented, single mother whose son (played amazingly well by four-year-old Cary Guffey) has been kidnapped, presumably by the aliens. While Neary tries desperately to figure out what is going on, in another part of the country a secret team led by French scientist Claude Lacombe (the great movie director Francois Truffaut) is investigating the recent strange occurrences, and the efforts eventually draw everyone involved to a climactic meeting at a most distinctive geographic landmark. Spielberg orchestrated that climax with so much visceral power that I once saw a fellow moviegoer weeping uncontrollably after the house lights came back up.The movie's emotional punch even caused Stanley Kaufman, the august movie critic of The New Republic, to call Close Encounters not so much a movie as ""an event in the history of faith."" In more proper perspective, Gary Arnold concluded his review in The Washington Post by saying that if real aliens ever landed and they didn't resemble Spielberg's vision, ""they obviously aren't movie lovers, have no romance in their souls, and to hell with `em."" However you end up reacting, you'll probably agree that Close Encounters demonstrated how Spielberg was destined to become a giant of American cinema.In an interview with Film Comment magazine, Spielberg once summed up his abilities by saying, ""I sort of know what works."" It's true. What's also true is Close Encounters works despite making very little sense - if start asking obvious questions the whole story begins to fall apart. No matter. Spielberg communicates subliminally to moviegoers so effectively that they willingly buy on, whatever the logical shortcomings. Along with the director's considerable skills at cinematic storytelling, the movie boasts dazzling and groundbreaking visual effects by Douglas Trumbull; gorgeous, Oscar-winning cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, and possibly the best work that composer John Williams has ever done.

783114222_33585	Reviews_movies_tv	"What makes this one of the best programs ever to watch on your DVD:- Facts are real, has plenty of information about what probably is humankind`s greatest achievement. The mix of real footage and amazingly created ones add to its real life/documentary spirit. But it`s far from being a documentary, although every fact is real. It goes beyond on the narration.- It`s not ""Americana"" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an ""America only"" feat. Congratulations!- Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other.- Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and its missions.- Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement. You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere.- On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s ""greatest"" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions screwed up the life of the first great filmmaker.- Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations!- Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was ""just"" a 12 episode TV miniseries.

783210973_34639	Reviews_movies_tv	This movie is without blood and without the satirical bite that I had hoped for. A number of good ideas are introduced, but none developed, most salient of which is the character portrayed by Sean Connery. There is way, way too little of him in this movie and way, way too much of John Lithgow's ultra-lame British Accent. The protagonist is a dud too. I was hoping for something on the order of Evelyn Waugh, or at least White Mischief. Instead I got something about as adroit as a Meryl Streep stand-up. This movie just sort of lays there for a while (too long a while) and then just dies.

783230346_48059	Reviews_movies_tv	I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.Check this film out.  It's worth all of its 128 minutes.

078201061X_32689	Reviews_movies_tv	"Neil Diamond is a huge favorite of mine because of his rich voice and his songs that speak to life, love and discovery of what matters in life.  Having said that, Neil Diamond is a decent actor - not great. His best scenes are when he is singing or interacting with Luci Arnaz.  The movie has nothing to do with anyone singing jazz, so be aware of this.  Yes, this is a melodrama about dreams fulfilled, family break-up and love refound but it is decent entertainment.PLOT SPOILER ALERT:The plot is about a NYC super-talented singer/songwriter, Yussel Rabinovitch (Diamond), who primarily sings as a Jewish cantor at a poor synagogue. He sings with his strong-willed father Cantor Rabinovitch (Laurence Olivier)who has plans for Yussel to take over as the main cantor once he retires. Yussel is also married to his childhood sweetheart, Rivka (Catlin Adams), who works at a local Jewish school. On the side, Yussel also writes songs for a struggling black singing group.  There is one troubling scene in which Yussel performs in black face and a wig when a member of the quartet gets arrested.  Yussel's life takes a sharp curve when his well-meaning friend and singing buddy Bubba (Franklin Ajaye)pitches one of his songs to a popular singer, Keith Lennox (Paul Nicholas). The song, ""Love on the Rocks"" is being butchered and the record producer wants the composer to help.  Yussel grapples with his desire to go but his wife (who refuses to join him in LA) and father argue with him before capitulating to him. Once in LA, Molly Bell (Arnaz) encourages Yussel to perform his song his way.  Tempers flare and Yussel and Molly are dismissed.  The two embark on a journey to jump-start Yussel - now known as Jess Robin.  The two finally get a break with Jess opening for a frontliner and fall in love.  Jess and Molly fight these feelings because Jess wants Rivka to join him.  Eventually, Rivka flies to LA to convince Jess to return to their life in New York but Jess refuse, having tasted fame.  The two part and love blooms for Molly and Jess.  Of course, Cantor Rabinovitch flies out to correct and retrieve his son.  Tempers flare and the elder man disowns his son for divorcing his wife and taking up with a non-Jewish woman.  This deflates Jess who leaves and goes on a long sojourn.  He returns to find he has a son but still no contact with his father.  In the end, Jess and his father are reconciled when the elder sees his son perform at their old synagogue and then in concert."

780020715_18516	Reviews_movies_tv	"Jean Cocteau was one of France's greatest poets, but he also made some magnficent films.  He only helmed 5 films (maybe 6) as director, but everyone bore his unmistakeable stamp.  This is one of his greatest films.It simply retells a fairy tale that we are all familiar with.  We know how it ends, we know how it begins, yet, everytime you see this film, it feels fresh, beautiful, and awe inspiring.  It's shot in simple black and white film (stunningly so by Henri Alekan, who also shot the original Wings of Desire years later), has no overbearing songs, no cutesy ""comic relief"" elements, yet Cocteau manages to make this fairy tale seem like it was written yesterday.  It is the work of a remarkable man/artist that can take something so well known and make it feel alive again.  Cocteau does that here.One of my favorite scenes is the ending.  We all know how the film ends, but when the Beast turns into the man, Cocteau uses his simple camera trick of running the film backward, making it look like Jean Marais leaps up (when the reality is he fell down and Cocteau just reversed the projection).  You know it's not realistic, yet it's so beautiful and feels more real than reality.  Is that art?  I believe it to be so.This was one of Criterion's first DVD's, and they recently reissued it with a better restoration (thought the first DVD was quite good), and also included is Philip Glass's opera based on this film.  I have the first DVD edition, and Glass's score as well.  I would recommend all of Cocteau's films.  They're all so beautiful."

I couldnt believe this kind of humor was unleashed at an unsuspecting audience watching this film. Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor in the world and No, I didnt like Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind because it is the opposite of what Man On The Moon is all for.You see, Eternal Sunshine just might be the most conscious semi dark heartful effort ever. All in all, it's consciousness is what makes it ""everything that is wrong with our world"". Man On The Moon is not for one second taking itself too seriously.I've always been a fan of Carrey but it is Man On The Moon that made me realise that there is no higher level of acting than this. THIS IS EASILY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE.Man On The Moon has the most extraordinary of beginnings and the story relation is different yet captivating and it doesn't make you wanna be anywhere else for one second. Based on the life of Andy Kaufman, this film manages to recreate the life of an extraordinary man. Many people felt Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman. The level and kind of humor this film contains is not meant to be understood by an average movie go'er. Between the 41st minute and 91st minute the film goes into an enjoyable dull period where most actions by Andy have no explanation.I hate Bongo drums but I cannot believe anyone can possibly sound better on them than Andy in the film. The reason the casting of this film is perfect is because Jim Carrey has one big heart for a comedian.

783239408_51864	Reviews_movies_tv	&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a lyrical, though tragic, story of lost illusions and lost hopes, told with much satiric insight. It depicts upper-middle-class suburbia as a paradise lost. The almost Freudian perespective of the film delineates the welter of sexual and emotional drives, as well as the projections and repressions responsible for shaping and influencing supposedly &quot;normal&quot; behaviour. The chief characters (the disaffected husband) brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey, his faithless wife (Annette Benning) and their troubled daughter (Thora Birch) are depicted as affluent reapers of the benefits of the American Dream, though their lives are hollow, artificial and pathetic by contrast. This film is a damning overview of America today. The haunting music score, cinematography, scripting, acting and direction are of the highest standard. The film combines domestic tragedy with mystery, character study and some stylised and epiphanic symbolism as in the image of the piece of paper floating in the wind without cease, circling endlessly, circling in a void, roaming as if in desperation, floating with no place to go.

076780192X_3410	Reviews_movies_tv	"We are not alone! screamed the ads when ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was first released to theaters in 1977. After 95 minutes of suburban angst, the viewer discovered they indeed had a friend from the skies.I was just a young kid when I first saw ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and I really didn't have a clue what was going on during the surburban angst sequences. But oh how I loved the finale, a special effects-choked extravaganza which became one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. The film's seemingly endless buildup had some kind of payoff, and director Steven Spielberg's career was set for life (well, he did follow this film with ""1941"").The spring of 1978 was the season of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters."" My friends and I would debate the qualities of ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters,"" arguing as to which was the better film. For me, a junior high school lad, the greatest film in history was ""Close Encounters.""I still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation, a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Invaders From Mars."" In ""Close Encounters,"" the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them! This had not been done before, as the alien standard was a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot.These days I still get a child-like thrill when watching ""Close Encounters."" The opening two-thirds of the film are no longer ponderous, but identifiable. The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed. Paul Schrader, noted author of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Hardcore,"" wrote the original draft to this film. One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen.Dreyfuss plays Roy Neary, working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO. He finds himself tortured by visions seemingly stuck in his head, and he becomes obsessed with UFOs. Like an alcoholic, Neary soon falls apart, losing his job, friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes. He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a single mother who has also witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions. Her son is abducted by the aliens in one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Together, this tortured couple eventually realizes these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Frantically, they travel there even though the U.S. military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside. Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs. The meeting place is, of course, Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain, stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens. An enormous mothership appears and contact is made with aliens for the first time in human history.This is not a simple story, and the drama which plays out between Neary and his wife (Teri Garr) is brilliant. Guiler's angst for her missing son is also perfectly portrayed by Dillon, one of the finest character actresses of this era. But the core of ""Close Encounters,"" the moment of truth so to say, is the sequence involving the aliens. There are so many hundreds of ways this scene could have gone wrong. The aliens could have looked fake, but they didn't. The lighting could have been wrong, but it wasn't. The aliens are portrayed as being just as shy as we are - a perfect choice. There's a sense of wonder throughout these extraordinary proceedings. Eventually, one gets the feeling that if we truly meet brothers from another planet, it will happen much as it does in ""Close Encounters.""If Walt Disney had decided to make a film for adults, it would have looked something like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Maybe Spielberg is the Walt Disney of the ""Easy Rider"" generation. And perhaps that is what ""Close Encounters"" eventually represents - a Baby Boomers' ""Peter Pan."""

767835069_15136	Reviews_movies_tv	The events of &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; play out in such a fashion that one tends to forget how soapy and melodramatic they really are. What begins as one man's emotional awakening to the events of his past in an attempt to help his sibling generates into a run-of-the-mill romance easily found in the pages of any Harlequin novel. And yet, through acting zeal and its abidance by the rules of tearjerkers, this film actually pays off in a weird sort of way.At the center of the story is Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), a middle-aged Southern football coach with a wife and three children. The film's calendar art opening sequence serves to show his childhood in an appealing light, yet his adult life is anything but enjoyable. His wife is estranged from him, put off by his humorous approach to serious situations and by his unwillingness to discuss the pitfalls of their marriage. When his mother, whom he clearly despises, informs him that his sister Savannah has attempted suicide again, he heads off to New York City, where he will meet with her psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand), to help her unlock the pain in Savannah's subconscious.The story's change in setting and story is the decision point for audiences, who can either accept the drama and enjoy it, or groan at the segue from the suicide angle to a romance storyline. Once in New York, Tom begins revealing events from his childhood to Lowenstein, who listens with a caring ear, perhaps more caring than the ethics of her career would allow. As their relationship begins to deepen, Tom reveals more to her, including a carefully guarded secret known only by his two siblings and mother, as well as his feelings for her.A heads up of what to watch for in this movie: its well-structured plot, which, despite its melodramatic subject matter, weaves a fine web of love, hate, revelation, and the courage to overcome hardships. The romance that eventually takes flight between Tom and Lowenstein is run-of-the-mill, from their shared family discord to their realization that it cannot last forever. Even still, these aspects are given some vitality: Tom agrees to help her son become a football player, and later antagonizes her haughty celebrity husband at a dinner party in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The bittersweet ending has been done countless times before, but it's helped by the fact that we have come to like the characters and can appreciate, if not comprehend, their situation.Even more interesting is the way in which Tom slowly begins to break down. As his resolve begins to fade, he breaks into new emotional ground, letting go of the hardships he has been holding inside all of his life. His family life is revealed in gritty detail, all of which provides reason for the attitudes he holds to presently. And when it comes time for him to break down and face his torments, we believe in his emotion because of his experiences. This is the kind of character we can come to care about deeply, through his many realizations and reawakenings.Kudos to the cast, which is stellar all around. Nolte shines as Tom, giving a powerful performance full of convincing emotion and forceful dialogue. Streisand's role as Lowenstein is good enough, better than most give her credit for; she gets the job done in front of and behind the camera with serviceable results. Add to this a supporting cast that includes Blythe Danner as Tom's wife, Kate Nelligan as his mother, and Streisand's own son, Jason Gould, as her character's son, and you have a truly becoming cast that adds zest and freshness to the script.Some may not think that this is enough for &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; to work, but in a way, it is. With a story that jumps from place to place, much like that of a soap opera, the cast is able to chew on the material with terrific gusto, making the changes of pace, setting and story easier to stomach. It's not a completely original piece, yet there is an appeal in its cliched romance, and a strong depth of feeling behind its characterization and human story. On this, the movie is a success.

So in addition to seeing one of the funniest movies ever made, you can be entertained for hours with the extras, and the extras are terrific: subtitles in English, French or Spanish; audio track choices -- English (the original mono or a brand new full stereo version), French, a directors' (Gilliam and Jones) track or a commentary track with Cleese, Idle and Palin; a copy of the script overlaid on the film; a painstaking, hilarious Henry the IV-ish subtitle for those who don't like the film; a hard-of-hearing feature; killer rabbit easter eggs; animated menus using Gilliam's original animation; karaoke renditions of 'Knights of the Round Table', 'Sir Robin' and the 'Monks Chant'; a delightful 45 minute visit to the locations with Jones and Palin; an educational film about the 'other' uses of coconuts; Japanese versions of the French Castle and Knights Who Say Ni scenes, including references to the 'holy sake cup'; a 1974 BBC Film Night visit to a location site during filming; photos of tickets, press releases, reviews, posters, production stills and original artwork; trailers; cast credits (Palin played over a dozen parts!) with pictures of each character; a Lego knights version of the Camelot scene; pictures of sketches that were never used (a killer snail?!); a web link.A lot of effort went into this special edition dvd, and it shows.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Jones and Palin visit locations.  They were in a jolly mood, their comments are interspersed with film footage, and they meet affectionate and funny fans along the way.If you like this film you will love this dvd version; if you love the film, you wil adore this two-dvd set.

783231032_48775	Reviews_movies_tv	"1941 (1979) Directed by Steven Spielberg. Score by John Williams. Script by John Milius and Robert Zemeckis.Starring John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Ned Beatty, Christopher Lee, Toshiro Mifune, Lorraine Gary, Lionel Stander, Slim Pickens, Treat Williams, John Candy, Warren Oates, Murray Hamilton, Tim Matheson, Nancy Allen, Dick Miller, Elisha Cooke Jr, Patti Lupone, Eddie Deezen, Dub Taylor, Joe Flaherty, Michael McKeon, Sam Fuller, Penny Marshall and Robert Stack as General Joseph Stillwell.On Dec 13, 1941, six days after Pearl Harbor, a very jittery Los Angeles population eventually goes hysterical over a percieved invasion by the Air and Naval Forces of the Imperial Japanese Empire eventually resulting in a riot and much property damage.Meanwhile off the California coast a Japanese Submarine is looking to ""blow the %$# out of something big"" for the glory of the Emperor!!Though a comedy, this based on true events and highly historically accurate film is oddly enough the last of the great Hollywood all-star WW 2 history epics and is basically a brilliant and affectionate send off of the type. A good film on being released, it has, as things have become increasingly worse film wise, grown in statue and quality. The Dvd release is the full intended director's cut restoring close to thirty minutes of footage---mostly with Slim Pickens, Stander and Robert Stack---which if anything make the film even better.The film failed at the box office and I never understood why until now. What liberal Hollywood wanted was a film smearing and making fun of the greatest generation ala DR STRANGELOVE or the typical Commie-Prop Vietnam film being made at the time but what Spielberg gave them instead was a loving Valentine to that generation.In spite of the some times risque ANIMAL HOUSE type humor, this is basically BUCK PRIVATES with a bigger budget. The period is captured wonderfully. Belushi smokes incessantly. Everyone calls ""Japs Japs"". There is a play off WHO'S ON FIRST with Pickens and Mufune. There is a restored sequence with Candy that is right out of HIT THE ICE. There is a fantastic musical number at a USO dance. The performances are magnificent. The script is funny and good history.

767839129_15817	Reviews_movies_tv	"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc brings to the screen one of the most well known Western European historical figures.  It is a rather long movie, but that is to be expected considering who the movie is about.The year is 1420.  The English and the French are vying for control over France, with the French being at their lowest point yet; the heir apparent (the Dauphin) is bankrupt, the French are divided and some factions support the English side, militarily they are on the defensive and are losing, while Paris, Orleans, Reims and other cities of importance are in the hands of the English.  It is at this critical moment of desperation and vulnerability that Joan of Arc appears to rally the French behind her banner and the ""Word of God,"" in an effort to send the English ""back to their island.""Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!  The only setback is in relation to the parts where she, yet again, finds herself trembling/twitching/hurting/screaming etc.  Have mercy on us please... Can we have a movie with Milla Jovovich not acting like that (i.e. EXACTLY as she does in the Fifth Element, and in the two Resident Evil movies)?  Is that too much too ask???  It gets so tiring after a while!!!Needless to say, John Malkovich, Vincent Cassel, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.The movie is action packed, while the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the battle sequences are all excellent.There is a wonderful feel of History; the clash between the English and the French is as fascinating as the conflicts between the different French factions, and both are presented very well in the film.History, Battles, Swordfights, and Intrigue, are all about.The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!On the negative side, the film is rather biased against the English portraying them as overly evil, while the French are presented much more favourably and with a stronger sense of honor (even having a better sense of humor).In a nutshell, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  It is a movie definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History.  4 Stars"	The English and the French are vying for control over France, with the French being at their lowest point yet; the heir apparent (the Dauphin) is bankrupt, the French are divided and some factions support the English side, militarily they are on the defensive and are losing, while Paris, Orleans, Reims and other cities of importance are in the hands of the English.	94:100	327:333	The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc VHS		lowest		"be_at(e, THEME=the French, LOCATION=""the lowest point"", TIME=1420)"	be_at(e, THEME=the French, LOCATION=points, TIME=until 1420)	#2=LOCATION	height	negative	y

There was much truth to what Gary Oldman's character says to the President about american involvement abroad.  And as such, for one of the first times, an american film is not so pro american.  Bravo!Now to detract.  If our secret service is as inept as they were portrayed in this film I feel sorry for the President.  And I have to say that at times certain scenes came off incredibly staged and unrealistic.  And some scenes just seemed very inplausible.All that said I have to say that the film is very entertaining.  I just wouldn't rate Air Force One as a purchase.

Karloff was blessed with a face that had many interesting angles and a pair of deep set eyes that were absolutely penetrating.The story is set in 1932 Cairo, Egypt. Archeologists have unearthed the grave of Karloff's lost love who was Egyptian Royalty in ancient Egypt.  Karloff was her lover and after her death, attempted to exhume her body and revive her from the dead.He is caught by the King's guard and is mummified alive and sent to his grave for centuries of time in the cold, dark undergroundof the pyramids.I don't want to give the plot of the story away.

767800311_3127	Reviews_movies_tv	"by Dane Youssef""Nil By Mouth"" is the very first film written and directed by the great Gary Oldman, a seasoned veteran actor who has still yet to give a bad performance. Oldman grew up in the poorest ghetto of South London, where this film takes place.And while this movie has been rumored and believed to be a semi-autobiography of Oldman's childhood and family (who wouldn't watch this movie and believe so?), Oldman himself has said that this is not him or his family.Hey, I believe him. Although he grew up in this environment, he was not directly in the line of fire, if you follow me.The film sets it's sights on a South London family that defines the term ""domestic unrest."" A woman, her husband, daughter, brother, their mother and grandmother. As well as the people outside their family who they are connected to.""Nil By Mouth"" represents many of the other families in South London, not Oldman's. The colorful cockney ways of the Great Britain. But more than anything, it's problem of casual brutal urban violence.We've seen many abusive types in movies--usually one-dimensional and sanitized. But ""Nil By Mouth"" refuses to white-wash. The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood star-vehicle allows this to be a real film-going experience.This movie wishes to illuminate. Not entertain or delude. This is ""slice-of-life,"" not escapist fantasy. I've told members of my family about it and they've given very mixed reactions. My father and sister disliked the dime-store production values and no-name actors. They asked me why I would rent such a bitter and hateful film. My mother says she has spent her life shunning this type of humanity and lives as if it does not really exist.""The Way Of The Ostrich.""This is one of those frightening on-screen performances in recent memory. Ray Winstone deserves high praise and immortalization for his acting here in the role of Ray. He seems to be one of those unsavory, brutal characters in movies that stay with us. Like Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence Of The Lambs,"" Like Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet,"" Like Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" this performance haunts us like a ghost. The scorned ghost of a murderer...There is a cringing moment in which Ray answers his wife's question as to why: ""I do it because I love you."" We cringe because his answer feels more familiar and common than it should.Ray is not merely an abusive drunk; he is a horrible bastard, always prone to violent outbursts. When his wife hangs out with a casual male acquaintance, he suspects that she may be having an affair and damn near kills her.Ray Winstone delivers a powerhouse performance in the role of Ray, a working-class man who loves his family, especially his daughter. But this man has demons. Demons that are so numerous and deep, they cannot be repressed. He can be a likeable, laid-back guy, like everyone else.But we see that without serious provocation, he instantly becomes raving and homicidal. A side that most movies (and people) tend to shy away from. He will make your blood run cold and near the end, make you cry.Kathy Burke, best known for her role on ""Absolutely Fabulous"" takes an enthralling dramatic turns as Valerie, Ray's wife who's sole purpose seems to be to keep the family strung together while putting up with her husband's monstrous outbursts, almost sadomasochistic ally. This is an unforgettable performance.Whenever there's someone like Ray, there's almost always someone like Mark. Mark is sort of a sidekick or cheerleader for Ray and his violently domestic antics. He seems to be something of a drama queen, hitching his trailer up to the pain in Ray's life. It perhaps gives him an excuse to explode and go ape-s**t the way he does. It's mentioned at one point that Mark himself was worked over by Ray's father---maybe this explains the tie that bond these two.Jamie Forman is effective as Ray's little right-hand man. Apparently, Forman himself is the son of a real-life legendary gangster in London.There are scenes where he shows the true symptoms of a violent criminal. I wonder... is the caustic streak of the father burning through the son? Jamie, unlike his old man has apparently chosen a more legal profession. Kudos for him.Is he just a great actor? Jamie may actually have some demons himself.And while Ray may be the black sheep of this family, all that really means is he's the blackest of the black. No one here is walking on water. Valerie smokes and drinks despite knowing full-well she's pregnant. No one around her really speaks up in protest about her indirect poisoning of her child.Valerie's little brother, Billy is a severe heroin addict. Despite the fact that he's occasionally allowed to sleep over at Ray and Valerie's, Ray even feeds him and gives him a banknote here and there, Billy steals a score of dope from their flat.You can only imagine how Ray takes to this. Billy is scorned, but although he is cast out, he still stays with his side of the family and even retaliates against Ray, stealing an irreplaceable family heirloom.After this, Billy is not really in trouble.He is all but dead.Billy is a severe junkie and spends a lot of time with his friends. And since Billy is a junkie, there's only one kind of clique of friends he can afford: more junkies.One of his pals, Danny is one of the movie's strangest characters. Danny is literally covered from head-to-toe with tattoos and body-piercing. He defines the term ""body art."" His whole body is like a big collage explosion.But he's not the one-dimensional freak/weirdo/thug we'd expect just by getting a quick glance at him. He shows compassion and even sweetness at time like all the other characters, even Ray.Nearly everyone drinks and smokes. Nearly everyone says ""f**k"" and ""c**t"" on a far more-than-regular basis. And their endless stream of profanity and brutal violent mistreatment of one another is like a sad testimony to how tragically pathetic they are.You can almost hear the violins playing on the soundtrack to each of their lives. They are the victims of their life, their family, their environment, each other and themselves.Oldman films using the now-traditional and all-too-common (but at the time, novel) hand-held camera technique and 16mm film, thus giving ""Nil By Mouth"" not the look of a polished, slick and lavish film, but raw, unkempt footage of very real life.The movie looks like a true documentary, the herky-jerky camerawork makes it look as if we're seeing everything from our own P.O.V. As if we're ""there, in the heat of the moment.""And we can't help but think about the little five-year old daughter and the unborn second child of Ray and Val, how their parents impact will undoubtedly shape them. It is an endless, vicious cycle of evil that shows no signs of breaking. And it is running rampantly throughout the world.This is just one of those movies that... after it's over, you want to do something... something to make things better.LITTLE TRIVIAL NOTES ON ""NIL BY MOUTH"": Unless you're somewhere in the European climate or at least Australian, you'd best hit ""closed captioning"" or ""subtitles"" if you want to understand so much as a damn line of dialouge. The thick cockney accents are almost indecipherable. They're so thick, you could choke on them. For me, it was almost like hearing morse code. The characters might as well have been speaking Chinese.SPECIAL NOTE: The title comes stems from a medical instruction in the hospital not to give a patient food or drink as they're about to go into surgery. The connection in that this movie makes with that title is poetically heart-breaking, like the rest of the film.danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]"	Oldman grew up in the poorest ghetto of South London, where this film takes place.And while this movie has been rumored and believed to be a semi-autobiography of Oldman's childhood and family (who wouldn't watch this movie and believe so?), Oldman himself has said that this is not him or his family.Hey, I believe him.	22:29	192:199	Nil By Mouth VHS		poorest		the poorest ghetto	ghettos, LOCATION=south London	#0=ghettos	poverty	positive	n

What do you get when you give about 230,000 to a couple of debutante directors and the rest of the members of the greatest comic collective the world has ever seen? Monty Python And The Holy Grail!Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a truly great film and in particular a truly great comedy - to still generate laughs even after repeated viewings.What is the film about? King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is seeking knights to join him in the court of Camelot, and after some run-ins with the French, eventually gathers together Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) and Sir Robin the Not So Brave (Eric Idle). After not returning to Camelot for reasons well detailed in the film, the knights are confronted by God who gives them an awesome task - to find the Holy Grail. Now the fun really begins! They have to confront the dangers of The White Rabbit and The Bridge Of Death in order to seek what they hope to find. Many months pass before the possibility of success finally arrives. But then again, perhaps not. In case you are wondering, Terry Gilliam plays the part of Patsy - Arthur's ""horse"" - but like everyone else also plays a bunch of other parts, so typically Monty Python. Not so typically Monty Python is the fact that apart from Dennis's mother, all female parts are actually played by females!With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget. And this was but one of their classic films! When you add into the mix a collection of some of the funniest gag subtitles during the opening credits, the inspired surprise opening and everything else, this is a true classic DVD release.Monty Python fans have been awaiting this sort of local release for far too long and to finally have it is to emphasise why.

Yes, it is very funny in spots, and it is a  parody of the American family, but it also features a beautiful, human  story at the end. Something that you don't see everyday in your average  comedy/parody film.The drama was perfectly balanced as well, so it never  really seems too much of either a comedy or a drama.Many people have  likened this film to Happiness, even saying Happiness was better and more  profound. I fail to see how that is. And unlike Happiness, the actors in  this film actually know how to act.Be sure to see this more than once.

780621832_23676	Reviews_movies_tv	Often a review for me is an opportunity to learn about a book, a movie, a piece of music that I had experience of in the past and have fragmented , incomplete memories of and certain questions about. For instance what I most remember about this film is the song, 'She wore a yellow ribbon' and with it a strange kind of mysterious feeling. I did not then when I saw it as a child really understand what was going on.So now after all the years I know the story is about Capt. Brittles (John Wayne) and that it takes place after Custer's Last Stand, that his final task as a cavalry officer is escorting two ladies to a coach which will take them home. I know that there is a moving scene in which Capt. Brittles mourns his wife. I know too ( from reading other Amazon reviews a number of which are truly excellent) that one of the most powerful and moving features of the film is the landscape, the atmosphere, the award-winning cinemmatography of Werner Hoch.And in my mind there is this vague picture of John Wayne and Joanna Dru( The young woman who is the romantic interest of the movie).Most of the reviewers say that this is John Ford's masterpiece, and one of the greatest Westerns ever made.My sense is movielovers can do a lot worse than giving their two hours to this particular film.

783239408_51913	Reviews_movies_tv	This being one of my top three all-time favorite movies, I was careful to read the unfavorable reviews on Amazon before I donated my own. The general consensus of those people giving American Beauty 2 stars or lower is that it is &quot;unbelievable.&quot; Generally, these people refer to the characters, the plot, all that composes American Beauty's quirkiness. How do I respond to that?If you found American Beauty &quot;unbelievable,&quot; then the film was a success. This isn't a movie about taking what we've already seen, it's about taking what we've always been afraid to show. The fact that people are shocked by it and have trouble finding the truth in this film means that it has succeeded in all accounts. If you find this film offensive, if you find it too risque, if you find it &quot;unbelievable&quot; then you are the prime reason why it was absolutely necessary that this film be made.American Beauty appears &quot;unbelievable,&quot; I'll admit that; but that is only because we are all so negligent to our own hypocrisy. So many of us REFUSE to relate to Lester, or Caroline, or Angela, even though we secretly know just how dead on their portrayal is. We can say Lester blackmailing his boss is unbelievable, or we can admit that we would have more than a little ambition to do the same when it came our way. We can say that Lester's idealized fantasy with a teenager is unbelievable, or we can look at the mean of male society and understand that most men would have jumped at the opportunity that he had.American Beauty's greatest gift is it's concentration of pure truth. This may be a hard fact for most people to understand and they may deny it to themselves, but keep in mind that with such a diverse selection of characters, humanity can not totally distance itself from EVERY character. Every one holds some internal truth for ever viewer, if they are willing to accept it and not rush to the extremes that classify the whole film as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;This film just makes sense; it had to be made; the fact that it turned out so well is amazing. Every time I watch it, I conclude the viewing with the phrase &quot;you learn something new every time.&quot; And that is the absolute truth. I become more in tune with my own self every time I watch it; I reach an area of my existence that I have never seen before; I understand my motivations with a new and heightened perception. American Beauty doesn't do that by taking vacant stabs in the dark, it does it by showing humanity's most disavowed characteristics, the ones we regret, we deny, we term unbelievable when it applies to ourselves.This film is a classic. Perhaps it will gain a greater mainstream audience with time, but there is no reason we cannot apreciate it now. The image is recent: of turn of the century life in America. This is US, at our best and our worst. If you're not going to believe just how depraved you are, then you have no reason to believe how moral you are. We are a species plagued with both sides of the spectrum. American Beauty is one of the first films to show this. If only people would Look Closer.

780622383_24184	Reviews_movies_tv	Dolores Claiborne  is one of the most beautiful book by Stephen King. But the film, in spite of all the shortcuts it has to use, is even better because of one actress, Kathy Bates. She does not act. She lives on the screen, and that is so rare that it gives to the film the poignancy of real life. It is a rare story too. The story of three women and one man. The mother first who suffers everything for her daughter. She suffers the molesting for her husband because he is the father of her daughter. But yet she gets one day to the point where she can't stand it any more and she puts a stop to it, though it does not change much, except maybe that it makes this father  become bent onto vengeance. The daughter who is the apple of the eye of her mother and she is blind to the mistreatment of her mother because she is in love with her father. In love forever, even when this love is exploited by the father to turn the daughter into a surrogate of his wife. She will forget it, full stop, period and that will be all. Till the day she finally remembers. Finally the boss, Vera, a domineering woman who exploits Dolores as if she were a house slave. And yet it is a love story too, the love story of two women who were neglected and wounded by their husbands, the love of two women who managed to cause an accident to get rid of their husbands. The love of two women that are so much alike and yet so different that they are perfect doubles, braindoubles, just like we have bodydoubles in the cinema. The father is limited in his brain. He is an alcoholic. He is his own daughter's molester. Then the story is that of the coming back of the memory in the daughter's head eighteen years later. It is the story of several knots in the mental plots that the lives of these three women are. Vera finally commits suicide because her getting old makes her hate life and become so bitchy that it is unbearable even for herself. Vera begs for Dolores to finish her up and Dolores accepts though she is too late and she cannot perform. Yet this is the prompter of another desire for vengeance in the main inspector of the island who was not able to have Dolores indicted for the death of her husband. And the whole film becomes the defeat of this old vengeful and hateful detective who cannot see human feelings and human actions but through the narrowing glass of his hatred. This trio of women is a rare situation in Stephen King's books, maybe the only one. It is a lot deeper than the women portraits we have in  The Tommyknockers . It is deeper because it is only human, with no special effects and no aliens. Just plain human beings with their emotions, their fears and their hopes. And Kathy Bates transcend the plot to make it nothing but a voyage into real life. And it is real life indeed. Not a real life we dream of, but a real life we carry in our memory and in our deepest impulses. We know we would do the same thing if we were in those very same situations. And those situations occur everyday in our world. A thrilling psychological journey into the humanity of women for whom death has the taste of life and life the taste of torture.

780626699_27087	Reviews_movies_tv	Alfred Hitchcock directed Mr. and Mrs. Smith as a favor to Carole Lombard (he was renting her home after she married Clark Gable) in this  sophisticated comedy.  Ann (Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery)  star as a wealthy Manhattan couple who engage in some prolonged marital  squabbles because they have agreed to keep themselves locked up in their  bedroom until the matters are resolved.  Some battles have kept them holed  up for over a week at a time.  After making up from one of these fights,  Ann asks David if given the chance to go back in time would he marry her  again.  He answers that he wouldn't even though he loves her very much.  David thinks that married life is too complicated.  Before you know it, a  man enters David's law office to inform him that due to a technicality, he  and Ann are not married.  David wants to keep this news a secret from Ann  for a while, but she finds out anyway.  Ann thinks that David is planning  to propose all over again, waiting for the perfect romantic moment, but he  doesn't.  This causes Ann to kick David out of their beautiful New York  City apartment declaring that she's not sure she loves him anymore.  When  Ann starts dating, David begins in earnest to win her back.  But not after  he spends some hilarious days at his club where he meets an old business  associate, played by Jack Carson, who encourages David to go out on a  double date with him.  Montgomery's scenes at the supper club are pure  comic genius.  In these scenes alone, he proves his status as one of the  greatest comic performers in film.  All hell breaks lose when Ann starts  dating David's partner, played by Gene Raymond.  When David finds out that  his partner and old college buddy is squiring his wife, he redoubles his  efforts at getting Ann back.  This is probably one of the oddest films in  the Hitchcock canon because it is completely lacking in what we have come  to expect from his movies.  There is no violence, no real suspense, no  mystery, no crazy mothers ruining their sons' lives, and so on.  But taken  on its own merits, it is a completely enjoyable film, which reminds us what  wonderful comic talents Lombard and Montgomery were and how the likes of  which we are unlikely to see again.  With witty dialogue, great pacing and  acting, including terrific character bits by Carson and Lucile Watson as  Lombard's mother.  Produced in 1940 and released in 1941, this film has  some footage of New York during the time of the 1939 World's Fair.  In fact  Lombard and Raymond go to the Fair after a dinner date.  This really isn't  minor Hitchcock, but it isn't what you've come to expect from the master of  suspense.  Perhaps he was trying to prove (early on too) that he was also  the master of any film project he decided to take on.  If you love the  screwball comedies of the 1930s and early 1940s, give this one a look.

783243499_54751	Reviews_movies_tv	This may be THE American satirical work of the nineties, and has a special resonance following the ENRON and WORLDCOM sagas that ended that weird decade.  We do need to keep reminding ourselves that a film is a film not another version of a book.  More than anything, Ms Mary Harron must be given full credit for the work whilst acknowledging her source material.  She needs to be spoken of in the same way as Julie Taymor whose brilliant work on Titus Andronicus should bear comparison. But in terms of satire, which I believe is at the heart of the greatest comedy, only Mr Todd Solondz perhaps is a worthy contender.  I found the set pieces in AMERICAN PSYCHO superb, the acting pitch perfect, and the mis en scene a model of its kind.  As there is over 300 reviews preceding this, I keep my comments brief -I only hope that Ms Harron has the opportunity to direct much more.

767817486_9561	Reviews_movies_tv	The only word I can think of to accurately describe this film. Midnight Express at its' core is an expose not of the Turkish prison system but of the brutality that man is capable of. Based on true events, Midnight Express follows the life of American Billy Hayes, who is caught trying to smuggle a small amount of hashish on to his plane. Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison. Billy endures endless torture both physical and mental during his tenure in the prison. There is one particularly beastly guard who looks like James Gandolfini from the Sopranos; anyway this guard loves to whoop up on the prisoners, especially the Americans. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns. The film score is nothing short of haunting. The use of sound and music in this film add a whole other level of horror to an already hellish situation. Some film buffs might also notice Randy Quaid in one of his earliest film roles as another American imprisoned with Billy. Overall, Midnight Express left me with a sick feeling. It challenges the viewer to endure countless acts of violence and brutality and yet still believe in the strength of the human spirit. A must own for any serious DVD collector. Highly Recommended.

This begins a period of change for Lester who quits his job, buys the car of his dreams, smokes pot with his young new neighbor and daughter's admirer Ricky Fitts, played by Bentley, and works out to ""look good naked"". His wife Carolyn, played by Bening, on the other hand wants to hit the big time in the real estate world and starts a sexual affair with the real estate king Buddy Kane, played by Gallagher. His daughter Jane, played by Birch,  is an insecure teenager who somehow befriends Angela who is stuck up and, as we find out later in the film, phony. She finds love in neighbor Ricky, whose father Col. Frank Fitts, played by Cooper, is an abusive former military officer.The movie successfully follows each character as the script builds up to the unevitable conclusion with Lester being killed. Director Mendes focuses most on Lester's character, who becomes the hero of the film as he is the only adult in the film who remains loyal and honest, but doesn't neglect the other characters.

076780192X_3397	Reviews_movies_tv	I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg. He might be thought of as one of Hollywood's sacred cows, but not everything he's done has turned to gold. A regrettable example of that would be ...Batteries Not Included in 1987. He has done his share of stinkers as well, but Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even more so than E.T., in my opinion, is his crowning achievement. I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977). Trust me on this, this is one creepy film. Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night, giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO. Enough has been already said of the film that hasn't been already said. The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr). Devil's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens. There are at least a couple of versions of this film. There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that's it. And then there's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to. I have seen both versions, so I should know. When you're younger, you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the &quot;Greys&quot; that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens). When you're older, you'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil's Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell's radio program). It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert, those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended). If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s, Close Encounters was truly that one movie. I am not much for Hollywood movies, because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized, or so mediocre, but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen.

078322947X_47450	Reviews_movies_tv	"I want to say right off that I think SORCERER is one of the greatest American films, period. It's also Director William Friedkin's crowning glory, asBRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIAis to Sam Peckinpah, orWHITE DOGto Sam Fuller. The film restoration and it's Blu-ray transfer is absolutely stunning. Because most of the film takes place in a poor, backward South American country governed by a corrupt dictator, and the plot deals with still contemporary issues such as upper-level financial fraud, terrorism, revolution, and the exploitation of the poor and the environment by ""Big Oil"" and their own government, it doesn't seem dated one whit. I saw this in the theater when it was first released knowing about the general bad reviews, although there were some good ones as well. Maybe STAR WARS mania overshadowed it at the time, maybe the title did deceive some people who had no idea about the plot in advance, but all I know is when it was over it had instantly become one of my favorite movies. Another complaint was/is that's it's basically a remake ofTHE WAGES OF FEAR...so what? STAR WARS was basically a modern take on the old cliffhanger adventure serials. THE WAGES OF FEAR is a great film in it's own context, but it just can't match the cinematography, pacing and intensity of SORCERER. It still probably wouldn't be a ""blockbuster"" if it was released today, the movie-going public's idea of entertainment these days are either ""event"" extravagances full of computer graphics, or the same old cliches, ""all-star"" celebrity casts, simple plots, the obligatory sex or nudity scene, and lots of explosions...just like STAR WARS (although there is a terrific explosion in SORCERER). STAR WARS is OK, I've seen it twice, the original and the special edition, where I've watched SORCERER every year since I purchased it on LaserDisc.  Everyone that I've shown this movie to ""cold"" couldn't believe it's not well known. It's just like people's experience with gay people, once they actually KNOW a gay person, or if a friend or relative comes out, 99% of the time they change their attitude and find they are not godless degenerates but real people like them.  I think European and foreign audiences are more educated about cinema and attuned to films that make you think, that don't need to have  all-star casts or happy endings. That's why films such a this or say,CROSS OF IRONorVIOLENT SATURDAYare appreciated more over there, with many readily available in restored deluxe editions on DVD and Blu-ray. I implore anyone interested in cinema to invest in a Region-Free Blu-ray player, you'll never regret it. If you've never seen this movie, don't read anything about it before watching. As long as you're not too sensitive to violence (that only occurs to advance the story and not gratuitous) or roller-coaster thrill rides that you'll be thinking about for days, let SORCERER cast it's spell on you......"

780621638_23485	Reviews_movies_tv	"When you break it down, life comes in stages; not just stages of development, but stages that can last for a moment, an hour, a day-- or indefinitely.  And they come unbidden and unannounced, like an uninvited guest that drops by and burrows into your very soul to ferret out the deepest hopes, dreams, needs and desires which-- consciously or subconsciously-- are a part of everyone who draws a breath upon the planet.  In spring, that guest may bring the joy of rebirth and life; in winter, it may bring a reflection of need and confusion, a feeling of loneliness and loss, the desperation of uncertainty or even despair, all born in that seemingly endless moment of searching and seeking out that elusive and intangible something that lies ahead, just out of reach.  The winter guest you can neither refuse nor turn away that is desolation of spirit; a visitor to whom we are introduced in ""The Winter Guest,"" directed by Alan Rickman.It's an especially cold February in a small village on the coast of Scotland; even the ocean is frozen for as far as the eye can see.  And in the harsh wind that blows in from that frozen sea, we find Frances (Emma Thompson), a woman who has lost her husband, and visited by the winter of indecision is held fast in her confusion, unable to move on with her life.  There to help her find the warmth of spring is Elspeth (Phyllida Law), her mother, who needs Frances as much as Frances needs her, though neither can find a way to break through the chill that has engulfed their souls.  Then there is Alex (Gary Hollywood), Frances's son, still in school, but on the brink of maturity awaiting on the other side of his own winter, a taste of which he samples in the form of Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a local girl who takes a fancy to him.Before it's through, the winter guest will visit others, as well; those in every stage of life.  At one end of the spectrum are Lily and Chloe (Sheila Reid and Sandra Voe), elderly friends who seem to stave off the inevitable by attending funerals.  At the other end are Sam and Tom (Douglas Murphy and Sean Biggerstaff), boys on the cusp of adolescence, who during their visit will learn that being of a like age does not put them at the same stage of life.  And as the story unfolds, in each relationship a different stage of life is revealed and examined, and we see the effects of this winter guest on each.Written by Rickman and Sharman Macdonald (adapted from Macdonald's play), this film is a study in contrasts, a pensive portraiture of life; sparse and reflective, Rickman captures in it the human condition at it's most fragile, and therein finds beauty.  He uses the original music (written and performed by Michael Kamen) sparingly, opting instead for the sound of the wind, the cry of the gulls overhead or just a backdrop of silence to underscore the dialogue and the drama of the story, all to great effectiveness.  By so doing, he allows the drama to speak for itself, to play out thoughtfully and in such a way that the audience is drawn in and included, very reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's style, though perhaps a bit more wistful at times.  And Rickman allows so many wonderfully telling moments in this film:  The young boy, Tom, looking out at the vast frozen ocean that seemingly extends on and on forever, as if he is looking out upon his own life, which even now is extending on ahead of him, forever; or Frances, looking out upon that same ocean, a frozen sea reaching out into the unknown, even as her own life is moving on toward an unknown destination; Sam, the same age as Tom, yet younger, watching from the shore, not yet ready and therefore unable to follow as Tom ventures out into the mists that cover the frozen waters.  And there's more:  Alex and Nita embracing their passion; Chloe, falling and grabbing hold of a railing for support, then finally reaching out to Lily; Elspeth and Tom, sitting together on a rock and sharing a moment at the shore; Frances taking Elspeth by the arm and helping her.  All moments that are profound in their simplicity, and all wonderfully presented by Rickman, with not only the eye, but the heart, of a true artist.Phyllida Law gives an especially engaging performance as Elspeth, as does Voe as Chloe; and Biggerstaff and Murphy are a delight to watch as Tom and Sam.  But the lovely Emma Thompson steals the show as Frances, with a superb, introspective and reserved performance that is entirely captivating.  She successfully conveys that deepest yearning that so readily identifies the winter into which Frances has entered in her soul, and her scenes with Law (her real life mother) are a subtle expression of reality, and a joy to behold.  But again, it's the prolonged moments of silence--created and staged so well by Rickman-- that are beguiling, and say so much about who Frances really is.  it's such a treat to find a film in which the director is wise enough and so willing to allow enough time for his performer to do what she does best-- as Rickman did with Thompson here-- the positive impact of which is certainly evident in the depth of Thompson's portrayal of Frances.The supporting cast includes Tom Watson (Minister) and Alan Rickman (Man in the Street).  Rickman found beauty in the bleak, frozen landscape of that small, Scottish village, then translated it so well into a representation of those troubling and disorienting transitional periods that can visit us at any given stage of our lives.  And, combined with his artistic eye and insight into human nature, it makes ""The Winter Guest"" a film to be embraced and cherished.  It's an experience you'll long remember."

783227930_46226	Reviews_movies_tv	This disturbing, haunting southern gothic film from director Don Siegel is one of the best, if least known, Eastwood films.Set in the deep South during the Civil War, Eastwood plays a wounded Northern soldier brought to a nearby, nearly deserted all-girls school to be treated before being turned over to the Confederate Army.  As long suppressed desires begin to surface in the headmistresses and some of the students, Clint slowly begins to play the women against each other in a bid to avoid being turned in.  Unfortunately, such passions can give way to much darker feelings and actions.Clint is excellent in a role that falls between villain and hero, and he is matched by the wonderful women in the cast.  As the senior headmistress, the remarkable Geraldine Page delivers one of her most controlled and effective film performances. And Elizabeth Hartman very movingly portrays naive longing and reticence.  Her performance here easily matches her more famous one in &quot;A Patch Of Blue&quot;.  Mae Mercer is fine as the wry slave who sizes Clint up from the start, and the cast of young actresses playing the students are all equally fine.One of the most striking things about the film is the use of color and light.  The deep hues and dark shadows are among the richest ever captured on film, while the use of natural light, especially the evening scenes and the candlelit scenes, are stunning.  The deep sound is also excellent.Unfortunately, this video edition fails to capture this.  The color is washed out almost beyond belief compared to the earlier video editions and the sound is thin with a noticeable hiss on the track. The earlier video editions were excellent, so there's no excuse for Universal's slipshod work on this one.Five stars for the film; one for the video.  This great movie deserves to be seen, but in a better edition.

767834739_14967	Reviews_movies_tv	I was rather disappointed with the first Resident Evil. It was an alright film, but it wasn't anything memorable. But this, this is a movie I'll be getting as soon as it comes out on dvd. This movie has TONS of action, and the zombies look real this time around. Remember how last time they looked kind of...stupid? Not here. The zombies look like they came from actual humans this time. The character's are pretty well developed, although sometimes Jill's toughness is kind of forced and she comes off as though she has no personality. She should've left the toughness to Milla Jovovich's character, Alice, since she kicked ten times more @$$, was tough, AND could cry at the end. There's almost no computer generation this time around, save for the lickers, which not even hours of worth of make up on an animal or human being could create. Speaking of lickers, this time the lickers(yes, there's more than one) are much more like themselves in the game. One even used it's tongue to kill someone! Yay! Anyways, now I move on...to the minuses. Dun dun DUN. Nemesis is probably the biggest weak point in the movie. While he resembles the Nemesis from RE3, near the end he begins acting a little...well...like a good guy. And although Nemesis looks real, in that same aspect he looks, well, silly. Also, the ending is kind of stupid. However, I'm not going to give it away to those of you who plan to see it. Even if you weren't interested in the RE films, Jill's hotness and Milla Jovovich's awesome frontal at the end make it worth seeing.

B00ZRPV052_451637	Reviews_Kindle_Store	MacDermott Ellis has definitely gone through the ringer.  After all Mac only blew his marriage to Carolyn, and then his subsequent engagement to Kate Mitchell.  It was about time that he does some much needed soul-searching.  Yet Mac is slowly pulling the pieces back together, and is now the CEO of Morris and Dean, a publishing company also trying to regain its own footing.  The past still haunts Mac though.  While being offered one of the biggest opportunities in his career by scoring a book deal with Wonder Woman, there is some underlying apprehension.  The mystery remains as to the true identity of this American heroine.  Who is Wonder Woman?  The audience finds that Mac gets a taste of his own medicine.  He actually meets a woman, Sydney Anne Sullivan, who is just like him.  Sydney is all work, work, and more work.  One of the most pivotal moments is when Sydney invites Mac to her farm in Vermont.  Its obvious that Mac is on edge around her.  However, Sydney also constantly doubts herself, despite being such a strong woman.  My favorite character is Sydneys sister, Jenny, who always offers the best advice.  There is nothing like two sisters discussing their relationships!  Jenny and Sydney have two very different lifestyles, but they are bonded with sisterly affection.  It is Jenny who convinces her sister to give the man of her dreams a second chance.  This book is not just about a second chance for Mac, but for Sydney as well.  It is about second chances for each and every one of us!  I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

B00CVNRWUA_167420	Reviews_Kindle_Store	I bought this book yesterday and stayed up until about 3AM to finish it.....I literally could NOT put it down!!  WILDE NIGHTS IN PARADISE is the 2nd novel by new author, Tonya Burrows.  It tells the story of Jude Wilde, the perpetual screw-up youngest sibling, who is haunted by a past tragedy,  in a family of 5 brothers and Libby Pruitt, a successful DA who he loved and walked away from 8 years ago.  When Libby's life is threatened by a stalker, her overbearing Marine father hires Wilde Security, a company run by Jude and his brothers to protect his daughter and find out who the stalker is.  Their relationship is turbulent and old wounds run deep as Jude moves Libby to a safe house until her stalker is caught.  Their love-hate relationship runs through a gambit even as their passion is renewed.  Tonya Burrows does an amazing job of showing all sides to this conflicted yet gun shy couple.  Jude is a wounded soul who, like Peter Pan, never quiet grew up and Libby is a woman still fighting to heal a heart broken many years before.  Burrows shows her readers all sides of Jude and Libby...their sorrow, their passion and their humor......and WILDE NIGHTS IN PARADISE is a perfect blend of all three.  It's not often that a book brings me to actual tears, but as Jude fights his demons and Libby looks deep inside herself to find the woman she wants to be, I found myself wiping away tears as I read WILDE NIGHTS IN PARADISE.  I thoroughly enjoyed Burrows' first novel SEAL OF HONOR and am looking forward to reading about the rest of the HORNET Team, but WILDE NIGHTS IN PARADISE totally blew me away.

Quinn Christiansen is used to doing things on her own.  She is a single mom, who has had to take on the world to care and provide for her son Cooper.

Single mum Paige, works two jobs as well as taking classes, which is determined to stick to her plan to get her and her daughter Casey a better life. Meeting JT was never in the plan, but she cant seem to resist him, his kindness or his kisses.  We have come to the last single McKinney sibling, JT, the youngest in the bunch. Like the previous two books in the series, it was really sweet, these are definitely books to read if you want good-guy type of hero, they may be a little broody at times, but they have no real darkness in them.  This book really melted my heart as we see the JT fall not only in love with Paige, but with her cute as hell little girl, Casey, as well. Casey also has had her leg amputated below the knee, and has done from birth, and seeing Casey and JT bond and hear her share her little girl fears about being the only girl with one leg was adorable and pulled at the heart strings. And seeing JT responding and encouraging her made me love him all the more. No wonder Paige fell in love with him, he was like her knight in shining armour. Although I do like it when a heroine saves herself, I cant deny that seeing JT wanting to take care of his girls when Paige is clearly exhausted was very endearing. And I liked how strong Paige was, she had her plan and no matter what she was going to ensure that her daughter would have the best life she could.  This book was both sweet and sexy and I really enjoyed seeing the last single McKinney male sweep his woman off her feet. I also liked that we checked in with all the others in the McKinney family and having some familiar characters in the background. I assume this is the end of this series as there are no singletons over the age of 16 left in the McKinney family, but whatever Claudia Connor does next, I am definitely going to try it out.

B00LQASRLW_314770	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"I had previously purchased Wendy Owen's book on arthritis so was interested to read this one about fibromyalgia. Although it's not something I suffer from, my oldest friend does - and has for years. I know that one of my friend's most frustrating issues was in simply trying to get a diagnosis, as many of her health care providers didn't really think fibromyalgia was a ""real"" disease. I was hoping that by reading this book I could at least offer up some alternative suggestions. Fortunately, this book had several.  I think the two most important things I learned was how debilitating fibromyalgia can be in terms of sleep. I know my friend complains about never getting good sleep because pain wakes her up. I loved the idea of the sleep diary because I do think it will help identify patterns like how sleep is impacted by stress or certain foods or napping, etc. I also think the chapter on a fibromyalgia diet was excellent, along with the alternative supplements that can benefit people who suffer from this disease.  Just like the author's book on arthritis, this one is well-researched and well-written."

B01D2RBMUE_564112	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Sean Ryan is visiting Nuremberg to present a paper at an academic conference at a time when Germany is racked with dissention concerning the massive influx of Syrian refugees.  The telltale signs of rising neo-Nazi influence among parts of the German population are growing. While there, he meets with an old friend from Africa, Eleni, and her companion, Jerome, who express well founded fear about threats made by an increasingly militant group of neo-Nazis against those of certain ethnic backgrounds. They cannot know that a plan is in place at a higher level the successful execution of which would result in genocide of populations of specific ethnic backgrounds.  Sean, caught up in the fate of his friends, and Seans wife, Isabelle, caught up in determining whether her grandfather committed suicide or was murdered are both caught up in the question of whether the Vatican actively backed the Third Reich and the Holocaust.  The Nuremberg Puzzle is an action packed book, the premise of which is profoundly disturbing on many levels, especially with the ongoing mass influx of Syrian refugees into Germany at the present time increasing social pressures in Germany to near the breaking point. The characters are sufficiently well developed to be consistent with the story, although very little real personal detail is provided about any of them. The focus is on the action, the core question for Seanwho attacked Eleni and Jerome; the core question for Isabelwhere is Sean; and the question of who Xena really works for.  Xena is a complete enigma as far as this book is concerned. Does she work for the Nazis?  The Vatican?  Another group, or is she a free-lancer with her own agenda?  Youll never know from reading The Nuremberg Puzzle but you will be entertained while you sit on the edge of your seat contemplating Seans fate, and the fate of those infected by the Nazis latest effort at genocide.

B00VRT92CU_422151	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"Readers who enjoy big fantasy adventures, steampunk, and adventure on the high seas will love Jim Butcher's The Aeronaut's Windlass, the first book in The Cinder Spires series. This is a very ambitious novel (630 pages) with multiple main characters, all receiving excellent characterization and development. The book has lots of action, everything from ship to ship combat using airships (with 3-D tactics) to fighting monsters to a literal catfight. Even readers who are not already fans of Jim Butcher and his Dresden Files series should give this one a read.  In the world of The Aeronaut's Windlass humans do not live on the land but in giant towers called spires. Most of this book takes place on Spire Albion ruled by the Spirearch (although he insists he is obsolete as the Council does all the work.) Spire Albion is ten thousand feet high, two miles across, and has 250 levels (called habbles). The world is powered by steam and magic. The military is armed with crystal-powered gauntlets that blast etheric energy, although the Guardsmen also use swords. The airships are powered by steam and sails, but also use crystals for lift and steering.  The book opens with Gwendolyn, heir of House Lancaster, defying her mother by joining the Spirearch's Guard. Gwen is a wonderful character, she admits that she is ""willful and blunt and arrogant"" and not good with people. She is always confident she is right and has a tendency to use her blaster gauntlet as the simplest solution to a problem. But she has a good heart and wants to help; she just does not understand subtlety and tends to speak and act before thinking. Gwen's cousin Benedict, a more experienced Guardsman, is part warrior-born, with feline eyes, and greater strength and speed than normal humans, although he tries to pass as normal and conceals his capabilities. Captain Grimm of the Albion Merchant [Air]Ship Predator, what we would call a privateer, was dismissed from the Albion Fleet for cowardice after a mysterious incident left him in charge of a ship. He is determined to do his duty to his men and always leads from the front.  Bridget Tagwynn, the sole daughter of a somewhat impoverished House, is reluctant to fulfill her family obligation and join the Guard. While unusually large and strong for a female, she is completely untrained in weapons, does not believe herself to be brave, and knows little of the world outside the family vats, although she does speak the language of cats. In fact, her cat Rowl, who calls her Littlemouse, is a major character in the book.  Rowl is a prince of the local cats and is convinced that cats are superior to humans. Butcher has done an excellent job creating a believable character who thinks like a cat, not a person, and the scenes involving cat culture are some of the best in the book. Still, Rowl is not at all comic relief, he makes major contributions to the plot and saves the other characters at least as often as they save him.  Two other characters, Master Ferus and Apprentice Folly, are etherealists (essentially wizards) with magical abilities to manipulate etheric energy. Like all etherealists, they are mad; Ferus is unable to master doorknobs while Folly only talks to Ferus or a bag of crystal she carries everywhere.  The Aeronaut's Windlass does a superb job introducing the world and its characters. Although the first book in a series, it does not end in a cliffhanger. Instead, after a satisfying climax that resolves the initial situation, the book drops hints of more to come.  Of course, the book is not perfect. One flaw is the romance between two characters that comes from nowhere and consists largely of one person rescuing the other and then worrying about that person's recovery. The book also is unclear on just what the etherealists can and cannot do. However, these are minor flaws in an overall success. The Aeronaut's Windlass combines great characters, great action, and a background with the best features of steampunk and traditional fantasy. Butcher skillfully uses humor without undercutting the drama.  This new series has the potential to be an even bigger hitter than Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. Anyone who enjoys fantasy will love this book."

B00CTYBHT8_166771	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"My 4.5 star review from Guilty Pleasures book reviews:  I'll admit I fell for Gianni hook, line, and sinker when he made a play for Marco's landlady in the second book in this series.  I love his easy going personality and his flirty nature but most of all I love how he sees the beauty in all women.  It's hard not to fall for a man like him and Kianna Jones found that out after the first time they meet. Gianni (Gee) is an airman or more specifically a PJ in the Air Force.  For those wondering a PJ is a pararescue jumper and they are highly trained to rescue and treat those in danger or who have been wounded.  Gee is the youngest of four brothers so he's always felt he's had to prove himself to them.  I think this also makes him seem more mature than men his age, not to mention growing up in a military household he's lived it his whole life.  He dates and enjoys himself with women but finds himself completely out of his element when he sees Kianna for the first time.  Kianna Jones is a well liked and well respected English professor yet when a young airman offers to buy her morning coffee and treat at a local coffee shop she can't seem to form a coherent sentence.  After sitting and talking with him, Kianna feels she's out of her element but there is just something about Gianni that makes her want to know more.  I really loved these two together.  Gianni (I'm kind of like Kianna that I hate not using such a beautiful name and Gee sounds like a baby) just won't give up his pursuit of her and for every one of her reasons why they shouldn't be together he's there with a comeback.  The fact that he doesn't let anything stand in the way of what he wants leads me to believe that even though he's the youngest in his family, he has his priorities straight.  I flat out loved the email snippets at the beginning of each chapter so we really got to know so much about these two characters and know that even though they didn't spent very much ""in person"" time together before embarking on a hot love affair, they probably talked way more than most people do beforehand.  The fact that both could not wait to see the other following their separation was quite telling, and I will say they MORE than made up for the lost intimate time...whew!  Even their blow up was done in spectacular fashion but, their reunion was really great as well.  I've enjoyed the other two books in this series, but for some reason this one nudges past them as my favorite so far.  The chemistry between these two was amazing despite the age difference and I love that they are both very passionate in all aspects of their lives.  No matter what happens next, this has been a fun series and I've very much enjoyed getting to know the Santini men and the women in their lives including Mama Santini!"

B014PUR3AK_480353	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Divine Descendant by Jenna Black Urban Fantasy-May 16th, 2016 4 stars  In this series super heroes and super villains plot against each other.  The characters are based on mythical Greek gods and goddesses.  Divine Descendant is the forth in the authors series and it would be best to have read at least the first for the reader to get their bearings on the complex storyline.  Nikki Glass was shocked when she discovered that she is a rare Descendant of the goddess Artemis. As such she has the powers to track.  She and those like her live an age old battle of good Descendants versus bad Descendants.  With the leader of the bad Descendant freshly murdered and the murderer a enigmatic god named Anderson, missing.  Things are only bound to get complicated and deadly. Nikki finds herself on her own.  As she tries to find Anderson she is dragged into another potential disaster.  When a pissed off fertility Goddess bent on revenge threatens the entire race.  Can Nikki save herself and those she loves or will she be too late?  In the latest installment of the Descendant series, Nikki is finding her stride.  And whom she can trust.  Tough, gruff and with heroic heart.  Nikki Glass is a fun whirlwind of a read.  This series is in the first person and Nikki has the personality that will fascinate.  But one of her biggest puzzles is the mysterious Anderson.  He is a dark, hot enigma, but one Nikki has decided to try to stay clear of in the personal sense.  He confuses her and his ex is as scary as hell.  But with the threat of annihilation, Nikki finds she must work with the frustratingly elusive Anderson -if she can find him!  I liked that we learn more about the other Descendant and discover the vulnerabilities and motivations.  But the best part is that Nikki has Jamaal for support.  This series has many secrets which guarantees many more books, yeah!  Especially the mystery behind Nikki's lost mother and brother.  Nikki was abandoned by them and is still troubled by being left behind.  I want to learn more!  This satisfying Urban Fantasy will enthrall lovers of Greek mythology and the paranormal.

Enjoyed that ""true love/mates"" could help heal messed up trauma. Liked how the plots from one story flowed to another around the evil villains. However, if Grayson is second to the strongest Alpha in the world why was he unable to best the London Alpha, not once but twice.  I did enjoy the fact that the ladies were all able to gain their own strength and voice and eventually overcome their greatest fears. Overall a good read with some hiccups but worth wading through them. Curious what happened to the two sisters, they kinda disappeared after Gina mated. About the cover- the woman on the cover doesn't appear to be a larger woman. It would be nice if you are writing stories about big beautiful women with curves and a little extra meat- the cover showed a larger woman.  A lot of books about curvy women have skinny or medium built women on the cover. A cover that better depicts the women in the stories would be appreciated."

B006KWAKDE_67021	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"The Selection by Kiera Cass fills some deep need in me to read a sappy romantic book. And for the most part that is what this book is. With the beautiful dresses, the mean girls, the two handsome young men, this was the perfect fluff book for me. First I want to say that I did have a couple of issues with it but none that kept be from giving it a good review. Sometimes I felt like this book pulled a little much from the Hunger Games. With their televised ""Capitol Report"" and rebels fighting the government it seemed familiar at points. But that is where most of the YA genre is now a days and so I had to push aside my reservations and continue reading. The only other issue that I had with this book was that often times the writing seemed quite juvenile, much like that of a scorned 8th grade girl. American got annoying at times with her inability to grasp simple concepts or her complete confusion at why her former lover Aspen broke off their relationship. Today there are so many bad ass central women in books and so this book fell a little short in that department especially when I know all the potential there is for women to be portrayed so wonderfully. But on the other hand I had quite a few things I enjoyed with this book. Cass is a great descriptive narrator. the endless amounts of dresses and hairstyles and different types of girl were are unique and stood out. Taking on a cast of 30+ characters is not an easy ordeal. I felt that Cass handles it quite well.  Yes, there were characters that barely showed up but they were few and far between. Every girl was different and so it was easy to distinguish between girls in the book. Over all I applaud Cass at her debut novel. And like with any debut novel there are a few kinks and quirks that would/ should be worked out. But over all I am quite happy with this novel and loved the other two books in the series just as much.

I actually found that I could not put it down! This is good information not just for parents who have kids that are overweight, but EVERY parent should read this! It is as much about being a good parent to your kids and giving them the best diet you can, while teaching them the benefits to a good, healthy diet. It is up to us, as parents, to teach them right from wrong in all things; especially what they put into their bodies.  I really liked the chapter on dealing with birthday parties and special occasions like that. They are tough. It's hard to imaging a kids' birthday party withouth cake, ice cream, cupcakes, soda, candy-filled goodie bags, etc. Sarah does offer some great suggestions there. Also helpful are the numerous recipes that both parents and kids can enjoy. She's got some amazing ideas for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, and desserts. I'll be putting some of these into my own recipe collection.  This book is easily worth 5 stars and is a goldmine of information at many times the price.

I loved Kia right away. She was snarky and sarcastic. I laughed out loud when she made fun of herself and cliches and stereotypes. I loved the way she stood up for herself; she didn't let anyone push her around and she snapped back when they tried. She also wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty; she resorted to snooping and spying to get the answers she needed. I loved her ability and the way she fought to gain control of it. She was a very realistic, relatable character and I loved her personality and her growth from beginning to end.  I loved being inside Ethans head! Usually, its the girl who has this epic destiny and the guy is along for the ride. But this time, it was the guy who had dangerous family secrets, with a future his father planned out for him, one he was told he couldn't run from. Though he accepted that he couldn't fully escape his destiny, he also fought against it, refusing to do exactly as his father wished. He took what he viewed as sad and barbaric and turned it into a great thing. Id love to see what happens next with the changes he made!  I totally and completely shipped Kia and Ethan. They were hilarious together and I loved their banter. Ethan had his moments in the beginning where he was really mean and pushed Kia away, but in the end, they worked really well together and complemented each other. Again, Id love to see what the future holds for them.  My absolute favorite character (outside of Kia and Ethan) was Sloane. I loved her personality, her attitude and the way she embraced Kia as a friend. There were two major twists with Sloane. One twist, I loved! It was so cool and epic and it fit her personality perfectly. The second twist broke my heart and had me screaming at my iPad. But then that ending!!! I definitely didn't see that coming and Im very pleased with the way Sloanes story ended. Id definitely like to read more and see what happens next!  Another character I loved was Abby. Shes so fierce, kind and protective. I loved the revelations she shared with Kia and I loved the twist at the end with her. Clare and Sara were great characters, as well, though we didn't see as much of them. And Tobias wasn't too bad.  I couldn't stand Justine in the beginning. She was so mean and horrible. I understand why she behaved the way she did, though, and she redeemed herself in the end. Justin always seemed to be in the background. I felt really bad for Colt, though. That was heartbreaking! And, of course, I couldn't stand Holden, Ethans father. I cant even really explain why, because he was really nice to Kia in the beginning. But I just didn't trust him at all. I think part of that was because I hated how he treated Ethan and his friends. It was obvious the Cabal had consumed Holden. Plus, he had a little bit of a power trip fueling his actions.  The major twist at the end was epic, but I also figured it out pretty early on, mostly because Im a huge fan of Charmed and recognized the big bad creature for what it really was. It was heartbreaking to see Ethan come to terms with it, though. But it was very well done and even though I figured it out, I still enjoyed seeing it play out. The other major twist at the end (which I briefly mentioned earlier) shocked and saddened me, but I loved the way it played out, as well.  Like I said, Ive read all of Alyxandra Harveys books. And I must say (Again, despite being a HUGE Drake Chronicles fan), Harveys writing in Red was her best yet. It flowed so nicely and I never felt confused or lost. The plot was epic and (at least for me) very original and intriguing. I especially loved all the mythological creatures and supernatural elements! I would REALLY LOVE to see a sequel for this! The ending felt a little rushed and, considering where all the characters left off at the end of Red, Id love to see what happens next for all of them.  I absolutely, highly recommend this book. If you're already a fan of Alyxandra Harvey, youll love it! And if you haven't read any of her books, Id suggest starting with this one or The Drake Chronicles.	And I must say (Again, despite being a HUGE Drake Chronicles fan), Harveys writing in Red was her best yet.	98:102	3971:3975	Red eBook		best		write(e, AGENT=Alyxandra Harvey, RESULT=Red)	write(e, AGENT=Alyxandra Harvey, RESULT=*, TIME=yet)	#0=e	quality	positive	y		
B01FOADHGY_585736	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Karens last argument with her sister still rang loud and clear in her head.  While Kaya and Trey had indeed rescued her, and even now were on their way far away from the lights of Las Vegas  she found herself drawn back to the city where one bear shifter, one diamond and a plan of revenge for her kind continued to churn in her mind.  She couldn't get him out of her head, sure it had been one amazing night but he certainly hadnt contacted her for another date.  And in spite of her dragon making mate noises, Karen had bigger things to deal with right now.  Like getting the Blood Diamond back from those who had stolen it from the dragons years ago.  Which is why shes standing on this ledge across from the casino where her prize is kept captive trying to convince herself that she can indeed glide, not fly, over to that building without killing herself in the flight.  Tanner had come to Las Vegas at the urging of his clan.  He had to spend some time far away from his mountain home in this crowded, smelly city in order to put the plan into play.  He really hadnt counted on hooking up with the beautiful dragon shifter, or for that matter, constantly hearing his bear carry on a conversation about mates and forever after in his head.  His head needed to stay clear in order for this crazy plan to work.  His position in security at the vampires casino had made the next stage of his plan fall into place.  Sure, details still to work out but at least he had a better chance now.  That was until alarms went off all over the casino, and he watched his mate struggling in the arms of the baddest, meanest vampire in Las Vegas  the owner of this casino, Igor.  And the vampire he also was plotting against.  What in the world had she done?  Gambling On Her Bear is such a fun, sexy adventure of watching a half witch, half dragon shifter and a bear shifter fall in lust, and in love while somehow combining their plots against this particular vampire.  The action is fast paced, humorous from giggles to laugh out loud moments and sexy as only a sizzlin dragon and bear can possibly be together.  Watching Karen come into her own, accepting her power and her realization at the end was worthy of the fist-pump I mentally gave her.  *grin*  Youll understand when you get to that part.  If you love Shifter Romance.  If fun, sexy and lighthearted with a touch of danger is your thing  then you're gonna love Gambling On Her Bear.

B01DJXPYL4_570150	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Title: Hell Squad Box Set Author: Anna Hackett Designation: Books One thru Three, Each is a Standalone with NO Cliffhanger My Rating: FIVE SERIOUS SEXY, ACTION-PACKED STARS***** OMG! I love, love, love this series! I first became aware of Anna Hackett's Hell Squad Series a few months ago when I noticed Hell Squad: Marcus, the first book of this series was offered as a free download from Amazon. Well, like so many other folks, I just can't pass up a freebie so I said, what the heck, I'll try it. Since it's free, I have nothing to lose, right?  And oh my glory!  How in the world have I not heard about Anna Hackett before now???  Where have you been my entire life, Anna Hackett??? I don't know but I'm so glad I finally found her and the Hell Squad Series. In less than two days, I read the first three books in the series and I'm a fan for life! I adore romance, I'm addicted to adventure and I love science fiction but it's just so darn hard to find a great combination of all three - until now! Anna Hackett's heart-pounding Hell Squad Series has given me all three, neatly wrapped in one fabulous package! I didn't think it possible but Cruz and Gabe, the second and third books in the series, are even more fabulous than the first. And I do mean more - more everything - more danger, more drama, more adventure, more action, more aliens, more emotion, more heartbreak, more passion, more romance and more steamy sex! The story is original, imaginative, modern, fast-paced, action-packed, thrilling, gripping, romantic, seductive and hotter than a firecracker on the fourth of July! The dialogue is smart, raw, gritty, imaginative, flows effortlessly and the narrative is exceptionally well written in the third person with alternating points of view. But the characters are my favorite element of this book. The heroes are hunky, take-charge, alpha males and the women are spunky, courageous, kickass heroines and their sexy, strong, take-no-prisoner attitudes will definitely ignite your imagination, light your fire and capture your heart! They are simply magnificent! Hackett skillfully combines these elements into a brilliant spine-tingling masterpiece of science fiction/romance. Thrills, chills, a few techie frills and a whole lot more! This is a white-knuckle, emotionally charged ride that will have you grabbing your chest, gasping for air and screaming for vengeance! Seriously sexy, completely captivating and definitely entertaining! What did I love about this book?  Everything! What didn't I like? Not a darn thing! Would I recommend this series? You bet and I am but only for adult readers since it does include some dreamy love scenes. Will I read this author again? Absolutely, just as soon as she releases her next book!  Earth has been attacked by a reptilian alien race, the Gizzida, and the survivors are struggling to fight back and regain control of the planet. Much of earth's population has been destroyed but a few have survived and are desperately seeking a way to defeat the enemy and drive them from the planet. Members of various divisions of the military have banded together and are now fighting together alongside brave civilians working from Blue Mountain Base, a secret underground military installation just outside Sydney, Australia. And the meanest, most vicious and most skilled unit of them all is Hell Squad led by Marine Staff Sergeant Marcus Steele. Begin the thrilling adventure with Marcus and his team of rough rebels as they attempt to destroy the aliens and find love along the way. Sparks fly! Desire burns! Passion flares! Love ignites! Action abounds! And we have lift off! I have to say, this is one of the most realistically written science fiction novels I've ever read! Fabulous entertainment and an awesome read!  I read each of the three books offered in this collection previously. Marcus, the first book of the stories was offered as a free download but I read Cruz and Gabe using the Kindle Unlimited program. Each of the books can be read as a standalone with their own happy ending but I highly recommend reading the entire series! Many of the same characters appear in every story but each book features one member of the team finding love in a new world under impossible conditions, and while battling aliens. Strong, decisive heroes and beautiful kickass heroines! Sigh...It's just so thrilling!

We met Cain and fell in love with his tough boy exterior and got to see Calla break him down.  In this book, we get to see softy Roan get even more softened up by Alina. But plot twist, it is his older brother's ex-girlfriend. Eyes on her and her only, you just have to slowly fall in love with him more than you already have as he described the first encounter of her. He wants her. She wants him. But fate seems to have other plans in mind.  Especially since there were so many roadblocks, I was getting frustrated with this book.  Do you remember Royal from the first book? Yeah, I didn't like him either because he was just a kid who thought everything got handed to him on a platter. That is the one thing that I hated about this... He wanted the empire but his little brother got it instead.  Want to know why? Because Roan is the gold-hearted man. He only wants what is best for her. For his family. For everything. He puts everything before himself and that just shows that he deserved the ultimate spot on top when the other leaders went down six feet under.  I am such a fan of Kathy Coopmans because she has such a fantastic writing style that will keep you on your toes through and through. So I mean, how could I not give this a 4.7 out of 5 stars.

B019D8UCDO_527563	Reviews_Kindle_Store	The Improbable Wonders of Moojie Littleman, by Robin Gregory, is an incredibly heartfelt and comical tale of loss, perseverance, and family. This wonderful little novel (310 pages) is full of magical realism and witty dialogue, both of which draw readers into the strange, yet fun life of Moojie Littleman as he comes of age on his grandfathers farm, St. Isidores Fainting Goat Dairy.  The book is separated into three parts, each of which follows Moojie through his whimsical heros journey to find a sense of belonging and family after his mothers untimely death. The first part of the book introduces our orphaned and physically disabled protagonist, Moojie Littleman, as a young boy growing up in the early 1900s. After his mothers death, Moojie is sent to his grandfathers farm, where he longs to feel like he is a part of a family, to know that he is loved, but is disappointed at every turn. And it isn't until Moojie encounters a mysterious group of people called The Hostiles just outside his grandfathers farm that he begins to understand the value of determination and selflessness. In the second part of the novel, Moojie works to gain the trust of his new friends, The Hostiles (who are really just a group of native peoples living off the land and the occasional thievery), and he falls in love with a wild and wonderfully brave young woman, Babylonia. Finally, in book three, Moojie is forced to choose between finally becoming one of The Hostiles and saving his remaining family from certain death.  In terms of writing quality and plot depth, Gregory does a wonderful job creating strange, yet heartfelt, dialogue. In fact, this wonderful grasp on imparting subtle messages of hope and meaning into the novel via dialogue is one of the strongest aspects of the book. While reading, it seems that every conversation brings on new insights as to what it means to be a part of a family and to overcome persecution. The author skillfully uses the physical ailments of Moojie to represent the mental roadblocks that he has constructed around himself over time, such as self-doubt, pity, or inability to fit in. Yet as Moojie grows older, he casts off both his physical and mental infirmities, replacing them with new strengths.  Overall, this book is an excellent read for young readers because of the subtle, but ever present, undertones of mindfulness and determination present in the narrative. In her work, Robin Gregory successfully convinces the audience to laugh and sympathize with her flawed main character, Moojie, as he bumbles through life on the goat farm. And despite that the dialogue may seem disjointed when you first pick up the book, the narrative style quickly begins to feel more natural as readers the story develops.  In summary, The Improbable Wonders of Moojie Littleman is a quirky, attention-grabbing book that is definitely worth the read. The storyline is chalk-full of Moojies misadventures and struggles. I unreservedly rate this book as 5 out of 5 stars, and am quite happy to say that its one of the most fun stories that Ive read in quite some time.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading magical realism and/or YA novels from the perspective of a lovable underdog like Moojie Littleman.

B01EMDH27E_578368	Reviews_Kindle_Store	This is not an in-depth reference but it is attractive. It's one way to introduce modern children to American History. The illustrations are interesting and the text is easy to get through. If you are familiar with the Time-Life picture books for adults, you will find the format familiar.  I thought the section on government was valuable. Many adults (apparently) don't understand how a bill becomes law and would benefit from the simple explanation.  Some of the illustration choices seemed odd. Various first ladies are shown in formal portraits and then Mrs. Obama is shown exercising with a hula hoop, for instance.  I hope that the edition I got for review was not a final copy, because a date was wrong very early in the book.  I would have liked to have seen Lincoln's Gettysburg Address reproduced in full. It's not long and it's one of the greatest speeches ever given. But I realize the book is an introduction to many topics about the USA. Perhaps each page should have a scannable code for youngsters who want details.  The format is graphically striking. Some of the headlines are huge. Fonts are readable. I felt that some of the stories are dumbed-down in order to appeal to people with short attention spans.

B009QDH5WS_109075	Reviews_Kindle_Store	"If you are a pretty mainstream American who's diet includes boxed and canned foods, a lot of processed foods, white bread, velveeta and american cheese, then this may be the cookbook for you.  However, if you try to eat fresh, local, sustainable, organic whole foods and avoid boxed mixes, canned foods, prepared meals and other processed convenience foods then this is not the book for you. I happen to fall into this category, so for me the book is disappointing.  My family has been eating gluten free for over 6 years so we've pretty much got the whole thing down. We're also soy free and mostly dairy free as well. In addition, we try to avoid the funky gums and binders (Guar gum, Xantham gum, Carageean, etc.) that are so common in most gluten free foods, such as gluten free breads you might find at whole foods and other organic style grocers. I also teach classes and consult for folks who have to switch to a gluten free lifestyle (which more often then not usually also includes soy, dairy, or other reactive foods as well).  I had been hoping this book would be a great 'one stop shop' for living gluten free, so was quite disappointed to discover how nutrient deficient many of the suggested recipes are, as well as the reliance on not only processed, packaged foods, but generally known unhealthy foods such as fake whipped toppings and canned soups (which almost always contain MSG, sometimes it's listed right on the label, but most often it's labeled as autolyzed yeast extract, yeast extract, or natural flavorings.  If you need to go gluten free and are seeking healthful recipes for doing so, my two most favorite cookbooks are:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gluten-Free-Almond-Flour-Cookbook/dp/158761345X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook</a>. It's a very small book but everything in it tastes amazing - even 'regular eaters' like the foods made from this one. However, you must use the blanched almond flour for the right texture and amazing taste. This book and the next don't use any funky binders or other creepy ingredients. The author uses agave for a sweetener, but you can easily sub maple syrup or other sweeteners as needed for your particular dietary preferences. However, my other favorite is much more detailed and comprehensive with very wholesome ingredients and tons of recipes:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nourishing-Meals-Healthy-Gluten-Free-Recipes-for-the-Whole-Family/dp/0979885922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nourishing Meals: Healthy Gluten-Free Recipes for the Whole Family</a>&nbsp;If you can only buy one, this one, Nourishing Meals, is the one to buy.  A great tip for those who don't want to use funky binders but who also cannot use eggs: Use ground chia seeds instead. You may have to play with it a bit to see what ratio works best for you, but about a tsp of ground chia to a couple tablespoons of water (then you let it sit a few minutes and it gels up) is pretty close to an egg (I tend to use a bit more though). If you use one of the tapioca based egg substitutes, use ground chia with it and it will be much, much better texture wise. Ground flax seed can be used in a similar way, but chia works much better.  Obviously this works for Vegans and others who avoid eggs even if they're not gluten free. But back to the book review....  If you want a 'one stop shop' overall book about living gluten free but don't care about the poor quality recipes, then give this a go. The other information is pretty useful and there are helpful guides for those just starting out. However don't bother with it if you are really hoping for good recipes to get you started as well."

B00632YGR2_60100	Reviews_Kindle_Store	I liked this book a lot, but as with other reviewers Jonny is one of my favorite Rugby players, ever, so my review may also be a bit askew. The book is terribly honest which goes both ways, it goes from quite hilarious to really sad, over and over again, in no particular order. I both languished with his falls, and his many injuries, and yet rose with the many triumphs, from World cup glory 2003, (to which I also own a copy of the  World Cup dvd, which is glorious indeed and well worth watching or even owning) to his very joyous satisfaction and success with Toulon.  I particularly like the way that it ended, not the 2011 world cup loss which I languished over as it happened, but that Jonny finally seemed to be happy with his life and to have accomplished enough to simply enjoy what he does. Then to end with a lot of pictures with little tidbits of stories of all the people you have been reading about, I thought was a wonderful addition to make it a bit more personal after so much struggle to simply enjoy life for what it is and what it brings. It is an uplifting ending for what seems a genuinely good bloke to use a good English, (that is British) colloquial phrase.  This will not be a book for everyone, but if you are a Rugby fan and wish to read about some of the back ground stuff to the sport, and one of the greatest fly half's ever, then I think it is certainly worth a read, and you may even find a few laughs along the way.  Thank you Jonny for your life on record to read and learn from, as much as you may from such a book, I do truly appreciate it.

B01E0LZ5OA_574304	Reviews_Kindle_Store	This is Sara and Matts story and what a story it is. It was awash with all manner of goings on. It drew a plethora of emotions for me that I hadnt expected and at times I felt as it was holding my distraught heart hostage. It was chock full of secrets, lies and love. It showed friendship in its many guises and dealt with the sort of grief that cuts you to the core. I adore these rockers and their abilities to absorb, process and move on, their capacity to love almost without boundaries or exception is comforting. Sara is desperate to move on with her life, to allow the relationship she absolutely covets with Matt to finally find its feet. I mean who wouldnt he is a sexy as sin guitarist with one of the hottest rock bands on the planet. But when her crazy assed ex refuses to back off and is determined to destroy her plans, Matt had his superhero pants on and is ready to sweep in and save the day but having a man step out for her in that way is an alien concept for Sara and it all takes more than a little getting used to. I hated that Sara was so unsure of herself, so prepared to almost hide who she was away and what she had been through. But the way she grew, opened up and allowed the love that Matt was willing to shower her with brought a smile to my face. She fought hard to let the right people into her life and in doing so her personality shone through, she was such a strong woman, she just needed the right team behind her to give her the strength to believe. There is nothing not to love about Matt and I do mean nothing. From the minute he laid eyes on Sara he knew she was his and he was willing to stop at nothing to be who she needed. He was willing to stick with her no matter what Michael thought he had up his sleeve. This dazzlingly handsome and sensitively creative man blew me away. He fought Sara tooth and nail to prove to her that despite everything she had in her head, he was there with her for the long haul and nothing was going to stand in his way, not even her. A sound read that had me glued to each and every page.

B0195XMW30_525524	Reviews_Kindle_Store	Ms. Stivali is most impressive, indeed. Most of her past writing is heterosexual romance. She broke the mold when she published the first books in her gay-themed series, Moments in Time. Im so glad she did. I just finished reading Moment of Silence, the fourth and latest book in the series, and now I wish I had discovered this talented author earlier. Dont get me wrong, this book stands alone just fine - you don't have to read the earlier books to appreciate the beauty and elegance of this one. But Id obviously missed out on some great reading before I became aware of the extraordinary work of Karen Stivali. Im making up for lost time by reading the other three books now (available as a compilation on Amazon). If the characters in these novels are as three-dimensional, engaging and authentic as the two main characters of this one, I will be a happy man and add one more accomplished writer to my short list of top, must-read authors.  What I like most about her approach to gay romance is that the characters do not suffer the self-induced, self-indulgent, obviously-manufactured obstacles, challenges and angst typical of so many books in the genre. Of course, her characters do suffer for love (the book is a gay romance, after all), but they suffer realistic problems, not roadblocks placed in their own way by their low self-esteem, insane jealousy, insecurity and oppression by society at large. And the challenge they do face, in Moment of Silence, is a doozy.  Both Jason and Quinn are remarkably sane, good men, beautiful men, young men trying to do good in the world, but suffering from the innate homophobia of the family members they dearly love. Jason is a good Jewish boy, the son of a rabbi, a learned, compassionate, renowned and revered member of their community. Despite his fathers legendary compassion, he disowned his own son when he came out. Funny, but Jason thought his father had always known. Apparently not. His reaction was swift and repugnant  he pronounces his son dead to him and the family. Sadly, his beloved mother and sisters go along with his fathers wishes and cut him off while hes working toward a degree in social work at NYU. He manages to get through the degree, but hasn't spoken to or seen any immediate family in years.  Quinn is also an extraordinarily beautiful and laudable young man. The oldest son of a devout Catholic family, hes just recently completed seminary and is soon to take his vows. But hes taking a sabbatical for a few months to contemplate the lifelong commitment he is about to make. He needs to be absolutely certain that he can fulfill his vows, and that being a priest is the best way he can serve. His younger brother, Collin, came out a few years ago (in an earlier book in this series) and his mother has yet to forgive him or speak to him. Quinn fears the same retribution from the woman he has spent his life trying desperately to please. Now hes confronting the fear that his commitment to the priesthood might have been for all the wrong reasons  to make his mother happy and proud, not because he has a true calling to the office.  In the meantime, Jason has become the director of the largest residential LGBT youth center in the city. Hes convinced his generous benefactor to purchase a new building for expansion, and hes in the middle of preparing and renovating the new space. Quinn is recommended to work on the project by his brother Collin (a friend of Jasons) and the two men become instant and close friends. Jason seems to have become obsessed, almost from their first meeting, with the gorgeous man with the big heart. It takes a while before he comes to realize that Quinn feels the same way about him. Friendship quickly morphs into love. Its not insta-love, its not electric jolts shooting up their arms every time they touch, its a deep respect, affection and admiration for each other, a remarkable level of comfort, and an intense sexual attraction burning just below the surface  an attraction that, once unleashed, changes everything.  Moment of Silence deals with its family challenges in a sensitive, yet realistic way  no false sentimentality here. But the abiding tension throughout the book is Quinns soul-searching. Jason, of course, cant bear the idea of his lover walking away from him into the embrace of his Church. Neither can he be so selfish as to deprive the world of the great counsel, spiritual guidance, wisdom and compassion of the remarkable Quinn. Still, he cant imagine his own life without the beautiful man he has come to love so deeply.  Quinn leaves Jason to spend the last week of his sabbatical on a silent retreat. He needs to wrestle with his soul. Jason doesnt know if hell ever be back, and pretty much falls apart. Were it not for his supportive friends, the kids he helps and his wonderful roommate, who gives him an effective kick in the butt, Jason would still be hiding under the covers, refusing to get out of bed, shower, eat, or go to work.  I won't go into detail about the resolution, but you know this is a romance, not a tragedy, so make whatever assumptions you will. Regardless, you need to read it, in Ms. Stivalis incomparable prose, to experience, to feel, the breadth and depth of the deep love these two men share.  The author doesnt pull any punches. Her characters are real, and their reality is likely to move you as profoundly as it did me. She nails the differences between Jewish culture and Catholic in the food, the attitudes, the humor, the different sacrifices required to honor the spirit. Its subtle, but its perfectly executed.  I never once felt manipulated, even with tears brimming in my eyes. Theres a core honesty about the book that defies manipulation. The expressions of love, tenderness and devotion are exquisite to behold, without ever becoming maudlin or sappy. The writing is spare, but rich, the dialogue so spot-on that I could hear the different voices in my head, as I read.  Moment of Silence is a wonderful book, one of my favorites this year - and not for anything showy or any attempts to push the boundaries. But rather for the virtuosity of the author, and the sincere emotions she both shows and evokes, so effortlessly and elegantly. Karen Stivali is a first-rate writer.  I just cant recommend this book highly enough. Read it, and enjoy the moving and heartfelt journey of two remarkably caring and very good men.

I'm just an average guy who happens to LOVE the George Foreman grill.  If I may be so bold, EVERYTHING you put into that grill is going to come out golden.  Wanna grill some peppers?  Sure.  Hamburgers?!  Of course.  How about some nice marinated chicken breasts.  Yup.  It'll all taste great afterwards.  For some, the patented inclined plane that lets fat and grease roll away is the charm.  But if you're into basting your chicken, then, guess what?  That fat catcher catches a whole lot of juices that you can then baste your chicken with.  Or, if you've got no concern for the fat, you've got a dish full of broth when you're done.  Whatever.  Bottom line?  If it comes from the George, it's gonna taste great.  I especially reccomend this product to anybody on tight time schedule.

B00005IBX9_28133	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"UPDATE:  2/13/2009 I've made 8-12 cups of coffee in this everyday since I bought it. It's still working great and making excellent coffee. No failure of any kind and the cleaning light hasn't come on yet. :-)  4/15/2003 The good: I've had this coffee maker for 3 months now, and it gets used every day. It makes great coffee, looks nice, very quiet, and has some nice features. I especially like the timer to have the coffee ready when I come down in the morning.  It makes up to 12 cups, but makes 6 just as well. I like the filter holder that comes out so you don't drip on the counter or floor. (Make sure to push it down until it slightly snaps down or the lid won't close.) Some have complained that the condensation on the lid drips on the counter. I found that if you just open it about a third of the way, pause for a couple of seconds, remove the filter holder, and put the lid down again you don't get the drip. My old Braun pumped out a lot of steam at the end of the perk. This doesn't do that. Steam has to go somewhere, so it stays inside the lid and condenses back into water vapor.  Some have complained about the cone filter, but I used to have a Braun and I'm used to it. I like them better than the basket filters because they keep the wet coffee inside better making clean up easier (pinch it shut and the coffee grounds stay inside) and it uses less coffee. Yes you have to fold the filter to fit the cone. Big deal, an extra 3 seconds out of my day for some really good coffee. The carafe is an easy pour and fits the hand well; no drips. The clock is small, but then it's just there for the timer. You want a kitchen clock, buy a kitchen clock. My stove and microwave both have clocks. I know what time it is in my kitchen.  The bad: It fits neatly on the back of the counter, but height is a problem. I have to pull it out to put in the water, filter and coffee. Pouring the water in became a real challenge, and my biggest complaint. The inside is black with a stair step level indicator. I'm short (5'7"") and it's hard for me to see down inside the water reservoir. Pouring from the carafe was impossible. I had to move the carafe to see where the level was. I solved the problem by using a small plastic pitcher, which I marked for both 6 and 12 cups. I would like to see the reservoir marked by an internal indicator of some sort.  The real test: To me the real test is, if I knew then, what I know now, would I still buy it. Yes I would. If there was an external indicator I'd give it 5 stars, but I'd still buy it."

There are plenty of recipes included with the machine, but if you really want quick, West Bend sells pre-made mixes on there website westbend.com, which have turned out perfect for me everytime.  Every loaf I have made with this machine has turned out perfect.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out, you can make more than one loaf when you have guests and serve a variety, instead of just one kind.  I have done that, and what praise!

It sat, neglected, on a higher shelf in my cabinet, and I opted instead to make coffee in a Bodum coffee press or, more frequently, get a cappuccino or latte at a local cafe.  Recently, I pulled out the Bialetti Moka Express and gave it another go after reading up a bit, and I love the results!  I start by filling the lower chamber with filtered water, just below the valve. Our local water, passed through a three stage RO filter, tastes just fantastic!  I set my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capresso-565-05-Infinity-Conical-Burr-Grinder/dp/B000VAWXOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capresso 565.05 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder</a>&nbsp;to the coarsest of the extra fine grinds (two clicks from the left), and gind one scoop of beans. It is important to use freshly ground coffee from beans that were recently roasted (ideally not more than 2-3 weeks old). I have been using the Hair Bender roast from Stumptown Coffee. Vigilante Coffee, Rare Bird Coffee Roasters, and Counter Culture Coffee all offer some wonderful roasts. Select something that resonates with your palette.  I place the ground coffee beans in the funnel. I don't tamp, but I do use my finger to gently level the grounds before screwing on the top chamber.  I set the smallest burner on my stove to just below medium heat, so that the flame is not larger than the base of the Bialetti Moka Express, and start the brew.  I open the cover of the top chamber as the espresso starts to brew. When I see bubbles without much espresso coming up through the opening, I turn off the heat and pour the espresso into a small cup. Note that one cup equates to about two ounces of espresso, which is just right for one serving. I then add about as much unsweetened soy milk, but the espresso can be enjoyed by itself or with a milk preparation of your choice.  I haven't timed it, but I don't think it takes more than five minutes for the espresso to brew.  I don't get as rich a crema as you may get from an espresso machine, but I also appreciate the simplicity of the preparation. Bottom line is that I love the taste of the espresso I get out of the Bialetti Moka Express!  I completely take apart the Bialetti Moka Express for cleaning immediately afterward, including the gasket at the bottom of the top chamber. I wash all of the parts of the Bialetti Moka Express with just hot water, except for the gasket. For the gasket, I use a sponge and a mild dish soap.  The one cup size is perfect for me, as I'm generally just making coffee for myself in the morning. But I plan to get a larger Bialetti Moka Express for when I have company!"

B00004R8ZE_6938	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	This pressure cooker replaced a Presto that I liked but its loose handle and rusted screws made keeping it impossible.  I am still getting used to this pot.  I use it on an electric ceramic top stove.  It takes a little fiddling until I can stabilize the temperature/pressure even using two burners, switching from the hottest to a cooler one.  I think with a little more experience I will get the right technique.  The long handle on the pot arrived loose and I was able to tighten it with a screwdriver.  I don't mind having to tighten it occasionally but if the screws rust in place like with the Presto, I will not be happy.  The screws don't look like stainless so I am concerned.  This 7.5 qt pot is deep.  I use a stainless covered bowl inside the pot and I have to use an aluminum foil strap to place the bowl in the pot and take it out when finished.  However the depth might allow me to cook two bowls at once.  This is a quality pot but only time will tell if the apparent quality is worth the price.  The Presto cost 1/4 the amount and cooked equally.  Hopefully the Kuhn Rikon will be more durable.

This product has the cheapest of cheap stiff hoses which kinks constantly cutting off suction which is otherwise strong enough to actually lift a throw rug off the floor. You can adjust the suction by opening a window on the hose. Eventually this can get so open that nothing is being picked up. Why not just set the suction for reasonableness and let it go at that? As others mentioned, I've had my hardwood floors scratched. It's important to vacuum with the grain of the floor which is pretty cumbersome. This while gripping the hose which often kinks exactly where the wand attaches. Really, this is a terrible product.

B00002N602_2774	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating, & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter, too.  Tonight, I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago.

B00004S8F0_14549	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"My Grandmother had a Waring Blendor. My Mother had a Waring Blendor. Why did I have to BUY one instead of ""borrowing"" one of theirs? Because they gave them away to get ""lighter"", i.e., cheap, plastic blenders, back in the early eighties. Big mistake. My grandmother died before she had to replace hers, but my mother is on her third cheap blender now. I expect my Waring Blendor to last the rest of my life. Fortunately, I was able to get my grandmother's Waring Blendor Cookbook from the forties. The current model still has the powerful motor, heavy glass container, super-duper cord and top-quality switch that my grandmother's had, sixty-odd years ago.  I also picked up one at Goodwill to have an extra pitcher to make two kinds of frozen drinks when I have a party. It is about forty years old but still works great, and it was obviously used quite a bit. (I only wish I had found it before I bought a new one!) The container still fits the base on the current model.  Makes fruit juice like a juicer, makes the best milk shakes, daquiries, gazpacho; it can even whip cream for dessert or froth milk for fancy coffee drinks! You can make a thick, creamy milkshake with milk, a frozen banana, a couple of ice cubes, and a little chocolate powder. You can even pre-chill the container in the freezer to make sorbet.  The secret difference: this Blendor creates a tornado in the center of the container, ensuring that everything gets evenly mixed. According to my Waring Blendor Cookbook, this is because of the unique four-leaf clover shape of the container, the shape of the no-rust stainless blades, and the high-powered motor.  You can use a wooden spoon through the hole in the top to make sure ice cubes get properly mixed if you find that to be a problem. (If you add ice cubes one or two at a time to the container with liquid already in blending on high, you will have the smoothest frozen beverage you have ever had with NO leftover ice chunks.)  The easiest way to clean it is to fill it 1/4 to 1/3 full of water, add ONE drop of dishwashing detergent, PUT THE LID ON, blend, shake and rinse.  Sure, it is a little loud (brings back memories of my childhood!) and if you drop the glass container on your foot, you'll be sorry, for your foot, because the container probably will never break. Notice that none of the Waring Blendor's detractors suggest an alternative.  If it isn't in the MOMA collection of Twentieth Century Industrial Design, it should be.  Buy a Waring Blendor and you'll never have to buy another blender. And neither will your children."

B00004S9G8_16022	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I lived in Europe for nearly three years, including one year in Milan.  I eventually learned to appreciate unadulterated espresso, no milk, no sugar.  My favorite is the Italian style ristretto, meaning a very short pull that comes up only half-way in an espresso cup.  (This is the way espresso is made all over Italy, but you have to ask for it special in Spain or France.) This only works when the coffee itself is of excellent quality, the machine is good, and the guy behind the bar knows what he is doing.  I've either owned or used a lot of non-professional domestic espresso machines, and I had pretty much given up on the idea of duplicating this experience in a home kitchen, either in Europe or America.  The closest I came was with the Nespresso machines, which make an espresso that most Italians will recognize as quite good, but which by no means scales the heights of the espresso served in quite average bars in Naples.  But I always felt that the espresso capsules were quite expensive.  On a hunch, really as a last ditch effort, I decided to acquire a Pavoni.  Because they are absurdly expensive if purchased new, I purchased one on Italian e-bay for about 110 US dollars, and had a friend bring it over.  I expected that the thing would be a fixer-upper at best, a project, an eccentric hobby. But after some fiddling with tamping (I had to buy a real tamper to replace the original plastic one) and after figuring out how to let the machine warm up and how much coffee to use, I pretty quickly learned to make an espresso that would make even people from Naples envious.  But here is the kicker.  According to information stamped on the base, my machine is 30 years old!!!  It has obviously been maintained well and I suspect that the seals have been replaced at least once, but the point is this machine is indestructible.  According to websites I have read, there has been virtually no change in the machine's design in 40 years.  Replacement parts are available.  I can almost imagine paying for a new one, it would be a worthy investment.  But if you can't swing that, check out e-bay.  Of course, let the buyer beware...

5509356839_1213	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"Dolly Parton once said that ""The hardest thing for a performer to demonstrate is sincerity. Once you can fake that, you've got it made."" Eminem would like us to think he's highly sincere, with his unending self-gratification, but with this third (or fourth, if you count the labored D-12 disc) CD he begins to come across as self-aware. He's the hero of suburban kids everywhere he proclaims in ""White America"". He's a ticking time-bomb in ""Soldier"" and ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"". He's a dedicated father in ""Hallie's Song"". He's this, he's that, he's the other and then he's back again. At what point does all this superego hopscotch become valid and at what point does it become the Eminmen Copyrighted Selling Point, that he can summon at will, and will continue to do so for as long as it makes a buck? I ask this because even as you're bobbing your head to the relentless beats conjured by Em and Dre, you'll still be getting the sense of deja vu. It really is the Eminem Show with Em, Mom, Kim, Hallie, Dre, and the nutty cast of characters popping in and out. He's as vocally dexterous as ever, (we could spend all day reciting the witty and memorable lines displayed in just a few songs.) and as I stated, songs like ""Square Dance"" and of course ""Without Me"" are guaranteed car-radio hits. It's just this: even hit sitcoms run out of new ideas, and Em is well on his way there; after he gets through ragging on family members, he contrives enemies out of thin air, (MTV tried to shut him down? The Source doesn't respect him?) Worst of all, he's starting to indulge in vulgarity for vulgarity's sake like Too Short or 2 Live Crew with the ultra-misogynistic ""Drip"" and ""Superman""; it's not just that these tracks are disgusting, it's that after staking his claim as the ultimate individual, such pandering like this should be beneath him. Those quibbles aside, it's another fun filled hour with MM, and he'll undoubtedly be renewed next season, even if the ratings start to shudder."

B0000505IZ_23240	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I bought this can opener to supplement my one touch can opener since there are times you need to drain the water from the can and cutting at the edge doesn't work right for that.

Not sure if it is because there is the tiniest dent in the can or what even though I can't see the dent but both missed spots are opposite each other. I thought the first couple of times maybe there were some dents in the first few cans I tried to open but it has done it on every can I use it on. Too bad I didn't know this sooner so I could send it back.   I know it is inexpensive, that is why I bought it, figuring a can opener is a can opener. Don't believe it, skip over this product and pay a little more for something that works. This is just a waste of money.

Well, let me tell you. It is. This thing makes french fries like Louis XIV himself (and a handy guillotine-action to boot!). I purchased this cutter to use for a party. I also purchased 60 pounds of potatoes and 5 gallons of rendered horse fat.

Anyway, I made up a huge batch of frenchie potatoes and they were magnificent. My guests all commented about how evenly they were slice. Okay, kidding about that, nobody seemed to care. But it did make the cutting faster. Soon, I found myself using this to make all kinds of fried things - zucchini, bananas, applies, lemons, hotdogs, small loaves of bread, a cornish game hen, a smoked chub, and a half pint of ben and jerry's.

Size: The Oxo salad spinner had the largest capacity out compared to other salad spinners. I think a handle crank spinner would be best for drying clothes with the capacity of the Oxo salad spinner. I can fit thin sweaters (size small) no problem.  Actual spinning: clothes require more centrifugal force than lettuce, so the button makes it a little challenging to get it up to speed, where a handle would not. Knit sweaters get the most dry. I think a handle would be better, even though I have to spin longer.  Stability - there are no rubber feet on the button to keep the spinner moving. So I have to use my other hand to make sure it doesn't move and lose momentum.  I give it 4 stars, if i was using it for a sald. 3 stars as a clothes spinning machine. Zyliss makes a much better salad spinner.

B00004W4UL_19711	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I have the rectangular version of this bacon/meat microwave grill and let me tell you - this is one of the handiest items to have onhand, especially for cooking bacon. I don't know about you, I really enjoy bacon, but it's a pain to cook and it stinks the house up for hours. However, I always jealously noticed how my mother-in-law's bacon always seem to come out perfectly brown, crunchy, and flat. Above all, her kitchen wasn't overly saturated with the bacon smell. When I found out she used one of these Nordic Ware bacon microwave dishes, I was flabberghasted. I went right out and purchase one. Now I make great bacon without the hassle, extra pans, and the extra permeating odor. The odor is now mostly contained in the microwave. The trick to having one of these is figuring out the time/power level formula for making bacon the way you want it. For me, it's 7 minutes on 80% power with a paper towel on top to keep it from splattering. I almost always get bacon the way I want it this way. It gets a little trickier when adding more than two slices, but it's nothing mind-boggling. An extra bonus is that the bacon grease collect on the bottom of the pan (keeps it from interfering with the bacon cooking). Makes it easy to collect bacon grease for different recipes, like collard greens. I usually collect the grease in a jar so I can have it readily on hand for whenever a recipe calls for pork fat or bacon grease. You can also use this item to defrost meats without making a mess of your microwave. You can either use the grill side, or flip it around and use the flat bottom side to do so. The lip keeps the fluids from making a mess. It's dishwasher safe, so all you have to do is drain off the excess grease/liquids and pop it in. The more stubborn stains usually slough off with a scrubbie-sided sponge. This is a great product. I'm very happy to have it.

B00002N5Z9_1992	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	Really, this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan. The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame. When you do it correctly it is secure, but not tight. There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on. This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape, but the tape needs occasional fixes.  The ability to close the window while the fan is on, and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan.	The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame.	4:11	68:75	Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches		biggest		the way the fan mounts to the window frame	issues OF=Lasko #2155A Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches	issues	importance	positive	n

B00004SPEG_16671	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"After a few joyous months with a loaned Krups FDD912 a relative offered me a Krups 654.  The contrast is unbelievable.  The same buckwheat waffle recipe that popped easily out of the 912 sticks to the 654 like glue, and yes, I let the irons heat up fully and applied cooking oil.  The ""non"" stick surface is totally different from that used on the FDD912; same cook, same recipe, opposite outcome.  The irons stick so tightly together and the handles are so hot that a wood wedge is necessary to get them apart.  Then, it's ten minutes with a toothpick.  Again.  Oh, and the power cord is only two lousy feet long.  If your kitchen is anything less than Sunset perfect good luck finding a good place to operate it.  And, as others have said, a nightmare to clean.  I could get the irons off the 912, but on the 654 they're bolted in forever near as I can tell.  Some other reviewers apparently avoided sticking; I wonder if my recipe is particularly prone, or maybe the 654 is less forgiving of some unknown bad practice on my part.  Let's put it this way: if your waffle making or your waffle recipes have a history of sticking, even if only once in a while, even if only slightly, you will quickly grow to despise this iron.  I have contemplated giving it away, but am starting to think I shouldn't wish this thing on anyone and should instead hurl it into the nearest landfill."

B00002ND67_3902	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"Feb 2012:  My review below was before they swapped the original motor for junk while pretending the unit's unchanged. It only looks the same but on opening my newest for 1st periodic cleaning bits flew out that proved to be cheap plastic tie-downs that couldn't stand the heat and the motor windings seemed similarly downgraded.  Check the web for fire hazzard recalls.  Jan 2010: To my original review which follows, I'm just adding this note that Lasko says this model only draws[when new] 83 watts @ High, 69 @ Medium & 56 @ Low Speed. The 170 watts reported elsewhere is in error. I also note neglecting to mention my need to avoid blocking daylight as much as possable, thus clear plastic for the 'shroud' mentioned below.  With no range hood in my city apartment, I've run these [at Mid Speed] virtually 24/7 in my kitchen window for decades, sucking fresh air thru the rest of the apartment while expelling  stove heat & air-borne greece, etc.  I'm comfortable with this because it's relativly easy to take the motor apart for a simple cleaning about once every 9 months [or so].  I've also added 2 4"" circular layers of the old, cheap, black, 'washable' air-conditioner filter material between the back of the motor and the interior protective grill to lessen the amoung of gunk sucked into the motor.  What with the cooking, this filter and, for esthetics, the inside grill are also removed & cleaned in the bath tub 3 or 4 times a year. The grills are a pain as soaps are only partly effective & brushes don't quite serve for the tiny grill opening.  With all this beating, the fans have all lasted an astonishing 5yrs++ !  BTW:  To deaden vibration noise, etc. I hang the fan from 2 springs at the top of the window.  I noted that with the fan running I could feel air being sucked in from outside around the sides of the fan so I've made a clear plastic shroud to block these areas for greater efficiency.  I've also taped bits of this plastic on the 4 corners of the inside grill wher some more air circled in & out."

B00002N8CX_3571	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I purchased this vacuum based on the recommendation by a friend who owns a cleaning business. She told me that unless I want to shell out the big bucks for a Miele or a Dyson, I will inevitably have to replace vacuum cleaners every few years. My friend uses this Eureka canister vacuum and replaces it every year due to her higher usage, but she swears by this vacuum. I have only used it twice now, but I am pleased so far for the price.  The vacuum does feel cheap. But of course it does. The Mighty Mite is a cheap vacuum, and this is precisely why I bought it since I am going to have to replace it in a few years anyways. The vacuum is easy enough to pull around on my hardwoods and to take off and reattach the floor piece so I can vacuum baseboards, ceiling fans, etc with just the hose. The vacuum doesn't work so well even on my lowest of low-pile rugs though. I find that since I'm too lazy to put in the necessary muscle, I am only moving the floor piece backwards since it's difficult to roll forwards on the rug. Overall, the suction is good for what it is. We will see how the vacuum performs six months and longer from now though, since my opinion may have changed completely.  Update: The vacuum has lost suction after using it maybe half a dozen times. Still does an acceptable job, but this is only after having it for less than a month.

Nearly every kernal pops, and the popcorn doesn't burn while it's still popping. We just buy the cheapest popcorn in the store. No need for the gourmet stuff.

I usually butter separately and leave the lid off for popping, because we like a really crisp popped corn.  We also use coconut oil to pop in, since it is a healthier oil than most other common oils.

B00002NC6E_3673	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	This item is advertised as HOOVER BRAND Type Z Allergen Filtration Bags.  I know this because I can see the name and photo match what I have purchased in the past.  What I received, from B&M Housewares, was an off-brand called DVC.  My biggest problem with these DVC bags, although they are Type Z fit, is that they do NOT have Allergen Filtration.  This is either FALSE ADVERTISING or BAIT AND SWITCH, as the price was a little too good from what I have seen for sale elsewhere.  It is hard to tell when ordering what you will actually get, but it should match the description and photo.  This is not the first time that I have received an item via Amazon that is not exactly what is advertised.  I am getting a little tired of returning items that are either wrong, used (when should be new), or defective. ======= UPDATE Shortly after posting this review, I found a note in the packaging with the DVC vacuum bags.  It was a note from B&M Housewares asking that if there was a problem with the order to contact them and not to post a negative review.  Unfortunately, I did not see that note until after I posted the above review.  I apologize to B&M Housewares for not seeing that before my posting.  However, I am not sure that I have ever seen such a note in any other order that I have ordered through Amazon.com, and I have ordered a lot of stuff through Amazon.com.  I now wonder if this has been a problem in the past, not getting the order correct?  A little odd.  Now, I must say that after submitting for a return/exchange, I was notified by Amazon that the seller was refunding my cost, but not requesting the item to be returned.  I did find that to be the case.  My cost was refunded.  That was very nice of them to do that.  However, I would have preferred to exchange the item for what I originally ordered.  That was not an option offered to me.  I really wanted allergen filtration.  I hope these bags hold up. ======= UPDATE # 2 I have not been able to completely get this incident off my mind.  So I checked the seller's ratings.  Apparently they are doing a lot of business through Amazon.  After reading just 1 week of ratings by customers, which was quite a bit, I did see a lot of comments that the seller is delivering products that are not what is advertised or in the photo.  So it was not just 1 mistake that I encountered.  It is happening regularly with this seller.  However, there were a lot of good ratings too.  BUYER BEWARE.

B00004WHWV_21131	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I purchased this coffee mug based on the reviews here at Amazon, and so far have been pleased.  I grew disillusioned with my Oxo Liqui-Seal mug, and saw recommendations for this cup on those reviews.  This Thermos Nissan keeps my drinks much hotter than the plastic-lined Oxo cup ever did, and does not retain flavors in the liner, so I can use it for hot tea and other drinks after drinking coffee from it.  The lid is a much simpler design, basically a circular insert that screws down to shut, and screws 1/2 turn to open.  The best part about the lid is that there are no crevices or little openings to harbor residue from coffee with milk or cream.  The Oxo cup quickly developed on off-flavor, since there was no way to thoroughly clean it, but this Nissan cup has a very straightforward design, and is totally cleanable!  That was my #1 criteria for a cup.  It is also totally spill-proof, another criteria for this busy mom and teacher.  It has been knocked over several times on my desk at school, without spilling a drop.  It is not as easy to open one-handed (ie while driving) as some other cups, but that is not my primary use for it, so that hasn't been a big deal.  The rubber grips on the cup and the rubberized handle are both easy to hold onto, even with gloves on.  It fits easily in my car cup-holder, and is not overly top-heavy or wobbly on a desk.  It is easy to clean; they recommend washing by hand, but I confess that I've put in the dishwasher a couple of times on particularly busy days, with no ill effects.  The one and only thing I don't like is that you cannot tell by looking at the lid whether it is open or closed.  The only way to know is to either try screwing it open or shut, or to attempt to take a drink.  I quickly developed the habit of screwing it shut immediately after every drink, however, so I know it is always closed.  Overall, this is the best insulated travel cup I've ever owned (and I have a cupboard full!).  It was pricey, but for my purposes, it was worth it to have a mug that I could throw in my bag, and know it would not leak.

It is the cheapest construction possible and broke on first use scooping cookie dough. This product is made from stamped steel which can be described at best as ""poorly and loosely assembled"". It is possibly the crappiest thing I have ever purchased, the articulating portion popping out of place after about 10 scoops of cookie dough. I cannot imagine how it could possibly be used for scooping ice cream. First off the handle is of terrible ergonomic design. If you attempted to scoop anything like ice cream your hand would be very sad very quickly. Secondly, the mechanism that is supposed to free the contents of the scoop is simply a piece of the handle metal bent inwards with teeth cut out and ""roll"" over a gear that has much too wide of spacing.

B00005CDPQ_25991	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I love this fan. It's not terribly large, 14' tall I think. The face is about as big as a salad plate. The base is very sturdy, not something the cat can knock off the desk. It has a great force of air which feels very much cooler than the air from lesser fans and while there is a distinct hum it's quieter than a box fan. I run it constantly because of perimenopause hot flashes. Now that spring has sprung so hotly in Seattle I need more! Drawbacks for me: The force of the air is so high and cool that if it's too close then my eardrums get cold and I feel air pressure on them. That may not be an issue for most people because I have damaged eardrums (which might be why it doesn't seem loud to me) but if you've ever been uncomfortable sitting directly under an air conditioner, for instance, that's what I mean. 6ft away and oscillating seems fine to me but closer, or pointed right at me, gets uncomfortable after awhile. On the other hand, you still get a nice cool breeze from much further away ( 12-14 ft) than any other fan I've ever had. At it's furthest range, in my house, it feels like a soft breeze (not too hot or cold) that comes by every 10 seconds. I haven't tried wall mounting it, at the moment it just goes room to room with me. I think I'll try that.

B00005CDPQ_26003	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	I bought this fan to replace the almost identical model that I had used daily for years. Some people have commented on the noise factor of this fan. While it is true it is not super quiet, the sound it makes is just what I would expect of a smaller fan pushing a high volume of air. I may not be the one to ask about the noise as it was not one of the factors that led to the purchase. I had had the other model for so long that when it quit, I did not remember it may have had a fuse link in its plug. I may have given up on it thinking it had just worn out before throwing it away and not checking that fuse! That just means I had it for so long I simply forgot about the fuse. The first one worked so well for my purpose I knew I would check to see if they were still available. I did look at other brands and models but this Holmes fan still won out.  There are a few mild changes since the last model but none reflect any critical issues to point out. I will say this fan works just as well as my last one but I am taking away one star just for something in the design that has always bothered me. This is not the easiest fan to clean. There are four screws that attach the front guard to the fan base and makes the blades accessible for cleaning. It's not the easiest fan guard to remove and put back on but it is functional. The problem I have is deep cleaning the back side of the fan housing. There is no real quick and easy way to separate the back of the fan to clean dust and debris from the inside.

B00004RC6R_9130	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	We gave everyone we know one of these poppers for Xmas this year -- with resounding success. And since they live in other states, we got free shipping through Amazon, too. The popcorn maker is easy to use and very easy to clean -- and makes PERFECT popcorn every time --  IF you follow directions!  I noticed a few people complaining about the popcorn being chewy -- this is the result of using too much oil. We recommend that you measure the oil and seeds according to the user manual for best results. The popcorn will be light and crispy, and you'll be amazed how little seed you'll need to use, since every kernel will pop!  Note: The base gets very hot and you have to flip it over to get the popcorn into the lid/bowl.  Highly Recommended!

B00002N62G_1850	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"I grew up cranking ice cream using White Mountain Ice Cream makers. I was delighted when my mother-in-law bought me one for Christmas 2014. Used it one time and the crank wanted to bind up then, but I thought, ""hey, it's new, just needs to be broken in a little."" Second time out July 4th weekend, the crank bound repeatedly. Then it began 'jumping a gear' causing the canister to not turn. After getting thoroughly frustrated and doing everything exactly as the directions said, I was so embarrassed in front of my company.  My father went and got his 35+ year old White Mountain Crank handle out that was a bit rusty and has not been used in 5 years. We attached it and it worked like a dream. I called customer service the next day and was treated like I was an idiot and got no where with the customer service rep. Though purely speculative I wonder if they are well trained to just frustrate you to the point you will give up and go away. My wife called them too--she was treated the same.  I have over 20 years of mechanic and extensive machine shop experience in building things that are way beyond the confines of a ice cream maker gear box. So I took the thing apart as well as my father's 35 year old White Mountain drive mechanism apart to compare and see just what is going on inside the one I have that malfunctions so bad.  The drive mechanism in the newer one has to be the absolute sloppiest made piece of junk I have ever seen. In comparison to the old one...there is not a comparison. The new castings are awful and not even close to being the same. That said, The White Mountain is NOW only a name. White Mountain, like many once-upon-a-time-American companied does put out the quality of product I grew up hearing about and using.  DO NOT BUY this Ice Cream Maker unless you want a $200.50 decoration for your rustic homstead.  . Go buy some Breyers and call it a day. Now off to the machine shop out back to do what White Mountain cannot do--fix their problem."

It is not so big that you won't find a place to store it, but large enough to hold a bunch of angel hair pasta that would slip right out of the little holes in a traditional colander.  It also fits over the sink so that I can pour the pasta (or whatever I'm draining) right into it, water and all, and have the water drain into the sink.  It doesn't say in the description, but this is a double weave strainer.  In other words, there are two layers of thin metal mesh to ensure even the smallest seeds and particles are caught in the net.  It has a traditional soft black rubber Oxo handle, too.

It really isn't any faster than doing my dehydration from my oven, and using three oven racks I can do more than this dehydrator. Yes, the oven is on, but it's at the lowest temperature and does not heat up the house. Further, my oven is silent whereas this device puts out a fair amount of noise (much like a large fan on the highest setting).  As mentioned above, the volume is limited with the four trays that are included with the product. In order to really take advantage of this device, you would need to purchase at least four additional trays, and four additional fruit roll trays.  Last, I was a bit dismayed to discover in the recipe book that many of the fruits needed to be ""prepped"" prior to being used in fruit roll ups or dehydrated. I was not aware of this additional step, and disappointed  that it was a bit longer to steam/boil/peel etc. the fruits before being able to use them.  All in all, it was an expensive purchase to do things that I can already do in my oven. Hence my original statement that I  may not keep this device and return it."

5509356839_1076	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	"Eminem's official third solo album (technically, it's his 5th) is the best one yet. He is a lyrical genius. If you aren't ignorant, and just think he is nasty, listen to the lyrics, they are meaningful, and they are very well written. His newest single isn't that good anymore, since radio has played it out. Here is a track-by-track review of the CD. 1. Curtains Up- 2 stars This isn't really a track, just a skit to start it out. He just clears his throat. 2. White America- 4 stars This is a great song, telling about how people just like and listen to his music because he is white. Definitely to be concidered as a single. Good beat. 3. Business- 5 stars This is one of my favorite songs on the album. It has a great beat, and for some reason, I hear myself singing the chorus to myself. Very catchy! Makes fun of a lot of stuff. 4. Cleaning Out My Closet- 4 1/2 stars This is a great song, has a good beat. About him talking about his mom is crazy, and he is moving out and cleaning out his closet. 5. Square Dance- 4 stars I like this song, has a good beat, and is funny sort of. Makes fun of people with a southern accent. Makes fun of Cannibus on it. .... 6. The Kiss- 3 stars A skit re-making the ""alleged"" incident when Kim was accused of kissing John Guerra, and Eminem pistol whipped him. 7. Soldier- 3 1/2 stars Okay song, with okay beat. I don't really like this song too much 8. Say Goodbye To Hollywood- 4 stars Talks about Kim, and stuff like that. Good beat, well written. 9. Drips- 4 1/2 stars Great beat, well written. Talks about Kim cheating on him and getting diseases, and giving it to him. 10. Without Me- 3 1/2 stars The song everyone knows. I don't really listen to it, since you just turn on the radio, and it's on. Okay song, mediocre beat. Good when it is new though. 11. Paul- 1 star ... there really is no point to it. 12. Sing For The Moment- 5 stars Excellent beat, very well written. It is meant to be a song to hear when you're in a happy mood. 13. Superman- 4 1/2 stars Great song. I like the beat, and it has great lyrics. You should definitely listen to this track. 14. Hailie's Song- 4 stars This is a nice song, with a good beat, and well written. Dedicated to Hailie, Eminem's daughter. You should like this song too. Good rap after the song. 15. Steve Berman- 2 1/2 stars This is the same stuff as the past two albums, except that he actually likes the album instead of hating it. You hear ""Ain't Nuttin But Music"" from D-12's album ""Devil's Night"". 16. When The Music Stops- 4 1/2 stars This song features D-12. Has a great beat, should be listened to. 17. Say What You Say- 4 stars This song features Dr. Dre. It is good because he produced this track. Eminem and Dre songs are good mostly. 18. Till I Collapse- 3 1/2 stars This song is a little weaker than previous tracks. Features Nate Dogg. Has a good beat, but Nate Dogg is only in the chorus. He should have been in a little more. 19. My Dad's Gone Crazy- 4 stars This song has a good beat, well written. Features Hailie Mathers! You hear her in some parts during the song wheh she said ""I think my dad's gone craazay!"" About when Eminem is acting weird and Hailie thinks Eminem has gone crazy. 20. Curtains Close- 5 stars This is so much better than Curtains Open. A hilarious track featuring the one and only Ken Kaniff! Here is what he says, mocking ""Without Me"". Guess who's back/Back again/Ken is back/Tell some men/Rub my back/Rub my back... You need to buy this CD! I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, but you can only give whole numbers. You should definetely buy this CD if you like Rap music. I really like this CD."

B00004YK66_22511	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	OK; so my lifelong inventory of pepper containers has been somewhat limited, Ill admit.  From the beginning where I used the rectangular tin container at the table, I eventually upgraded to a pepper shaker.  You know the type at most diners which you fill with ground black pepper flakes?  Then a colleague at work gently let me know, I was doing it wrong.  I should use a pepper mill since there is a culinary advantage to having the freshly ground peppercorns used.  I quickly saw the light and purchased a mill some 25 years ago.  That was a William Bounds Key Mill in walnut.  At the time the price seemed rather steep since I was replacing a glass container with a screw top.  But that mill performed at every meal for all those years without a problem, and still performs today.  So why the purchase of this unit?  After 25 years of use, the walnut mill was showing the signs of being older and the finish was blemished from rings and long fingernails from the last quarter century of grinding.  The salt and sugar shaker were glass and translucent which displayed the color and quantity of the contents, which removed any guesswork regarding refills.  So I figured a see through pepper mill would make a good candidate for replacement (I still have the walnut unit, like anyone would throw these away).  Enter the WB-1, Key Mill in acrylic.  The extended handle facilitates easier grinding with the extra leverage from the arm, and therefore delivers a greater quantity of ground pepper with less effort.  The filling slots are narrow but if you place the grinder in a small bowl or baggie before filling, you will recover any stray peppercorns which may try and escape (playing Rawhide as background music makes this task somewhat ironic and less intense).  Keep in mind that many blended peppers include allspice, which is not technically a peppercorn and much larger in diameter.  You also have three setting for the texture of grind: coarse, medium, and fine, which is easily adjusted by rotating the bezel on top of the mill.  The clear body makes it easy to identify quantity while acting as a showcase for your finest Tellicherry, Sarawak or Lampong peppercorns.  So after more than ten months of daily use, I can report the performance of this mill as being similar to the one which served so well for the previous 25 years.

B00004R90X_7188	Reviews_Home_and_Kitchen	The description is adequate.  You get a well-enough-made, non-stick, taco rack that makes four tacos at a time. It is pictured upright. The price is not bad for a specialty item but would be far cheaper if everybody wanted one. I expect it to last many years but it's not heirloom quality.  I've just ordered my second rack and may order a third to make enough for parties. I had to play with my method as I wanted no oil. The biggest trick is getting your tortillas flimsy enough to rest on the rack without cracking. This works best for me: * I'm using regular sized corn tortillas (35 calories no fat each). * Individually steam the tortillas for just under a minute (I use a bamboo steamer). Microwaving did not work for me. * Use tongs to transfer and place on the rack. * Bake at 350 for about twenty-five minutes (rotate rack half-way through for even cooking). I live at sea level in very low humidity. Other instructions suggest shorter cook times at higher temps -- my burn frequency increases when I cook faster. * Tacos get shaped by the rack but don't stick to the rack. * I bake tortilla chips while I'm at it. Cut the tortillas into wedges, sprinkle with whatever (lemon pepper is my current favorite) and spray with white vinegar to make the pepper stick. I suppose you could spice up your tacos the same way.  The result is a very crunchy, healthy, no fat taco. They are also slow to absorb moisture.

They cost just as much and are only a FRACTION of the volume of Bawls. So that was disapointing. This is the size of an original red Bull can. The packageing was good...They used bubble wrap or air pillows to ship it in the box. So even though the box was crushed , and even OPENED the product was still OK. To bad they won't package the Bawls that way. Anyways I put some in the freezer and opened it up about 20 minutes. Very ""wine-ish"" tasting. This is made with sparkeling white grap juice and you can taste that for sure. Its NOT something I want to sip on . Taste is toooo yuck for that. So you chug it down. It has a nice BOOST and lasts ok . But same thing as Bawls compared to OTHER drinks...The effect of the BOOST does not CRASH hard becasue it is a natural Guarana cafffine. So that was nice.  So its an ok product but I can understand easily why you cant find this all over town. The taste is not good enough....In my opinion. Would i buy again...Not sure... MAYBE...But my favorite is and has been the original BAWLS.

All I can say is, if original Tabasco is hot to you, then this is not for you. I feel as if this is on par with original Tabasco in heat but has a different flavor. Colon Cleaner is a mustard based sauce with a lot of flavor. It's main ingredients are Scotch Bonnet peppers and mustard. It is not so hot that you can't taste it like some other brands. It is one of our favs! If you like to change things up and have an extensive collection of hot sauce's like we do, this will be a great addition.

I am gluten intolerant and sensitive to processed wheat flour and most starches because of adult onset type two diabetes. However,  instead of gaining two or three pounds after eating bread, getting a pop belly, and swollen ring fingers, as I do with most breads, pastries and pastas, it was only one pound that day and went away quickly. I conclude that its effect was fairly mild because its  ingredients were much more benign than processed flours.  Used in moderation, as I do with all starches, it  did not cause my blood sugar to jump , so I will continue to use it.

I wasn't asking for free products- just wanted to make them aware maybe to offer a finer grind more suitable for baking as I found many low carbers online were also aware the brand wasn't ideal for all recipes. Would have given it 3 stars if not for the response from the company. It's edible but to get that texture that's closer to flour- this isn't it. Many store brands are better and less expensive.

Also, it seems to always be in stock.

B000CBFTC6_22714	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	I just got this stuff in the mail for my birthday. I know, an odd Bday gift, but I love this kind of fare. First thing is, shake it up really well or even stir it before you pour it because all of the oil builds up at the top and you won't get the full effect if you don't thoroughly mix it. Let me say that I am a heat eating heavyweight, so to say. I knew this stuff was going to be HOT. I reminded myself to be wise about the amount I used. I normally carry cayenne pepper in my purse as a personal condiment and I use a stockpile of habanaroes every week. Everything I eat is not just spicy, but tongue numbing hot. I will say. I bought two cups of chili and added ONE TEASPOON of Dave's 2009. I thought that would be a good place to start. Wow. Not so bad at first. Spicy, but pleasant. Then it hits the back of your throat and you have to cough. Then your nose is running. Then you are sweating. Then your ears and hair start to burn. It sounds nightmarish, I know. But, I love it and this was totally worth it. This stuff goes a long, long way. In no way should you use this stuff as a dip or drizzle it on top of anything, like your pizza. I believe it is best enjoyed when you combine it in small amounts (or large if you're F-ing crazy) to dishes like soup, pasta sauce, chili, bbq sauce, mashed potatoes, or any blended side dish.

B000CIXMKA_23077	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"Perfect size for the stove top popcorn maker with the crank.  Spot on salt, to oil to corn measurement and uses coconut oil just like the movie theaters do for the highest quality and best tasting popcorn.  There was a scare back several years ago, a movie theater popcorn was compared to the fat content in six big mac sandwiches.  Many went to using canola oil and others, but the coconut oil was no where near as bad as the fat found in a hamburger and cheese.  Today many theaters have reverted back, and coconut oil is found to help not hurt bad cholesterol counts.  It's still a good Idea to do in moderation, but you can't beat the good taste.  Recommended for popcorn lovers who get tired of air poppers or micro bags.  This is the real stuff guys, I'm now on my third order of this with the sample that came with the Whirley Pop machine.  Perfect for use on a gas stove and the high quality corn and just the right mix of buttery coconut oil and salt.  You can limit the salt a bit if you want, but it's really not overkill unless you're on a low salt diet.  These are a bit expensive, it breaks down to about 3 bucks a batch.  Made in the Whirley Pop on the stovetop, it shakes out to about 2 of the large bags of something like Pop Secret Microwave corn.  The difference in the taste is very noticeable however, so if you really want an authentic movie night in front of your 60"" TV, this does the trick.  You won't find those Pop Secret bags with coconut oil, and they just don't taste the same.  FYI, I've tried two other kinds with these combo packs available in the grocery or specialty stores, and this is by far the best."

B0001CXUN6_6457	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	I have recently been trying to cut out all of my artificial sweetener intake.  It's amazing how many products have these chemicals in our food and drinks!  Even my Metamucil had aspartame!  I've been looking for a low to no calorie sweetener for my coffee.  I have been hooked on Splenda, LOVE the taste.  Recently I've discovered that Splenda and all artificial sweeteners are really just carcinogens I'm ingesting daily. I did know about this to some extent, but once I started researching it and understood just how many chemicals and heavy metals are used to make these artificial sugars, I went on the hunt for a safe and natural sweetener.  Stevia is what I found to be the safest and most natural sweetener, even is used for medicinal purposes in some countries.  So I tried Stevita Supreme.  I first tried it just plain....and don't recommend that!  It wasn't a pleasant taste and I almost threw it out right then.  So glad I didn't! I decided to give it a chance and tried it in my coffee and was very surprised how much I liked it!  I think it tastes close to Splenda.  It has no aftertaste and sweetens my coffee just how I like it.  These packets are not pure Stevia, so I use them to the same ratio of regular sugar.  The only downside I can see is that Stevia Supreme is not pure Stevia, it contains Xylitol, actually more Xylitol than Stevia.  I am going to try Pure Stevia Powder by KAL brand next to see which I like better.  I've heard good reviews about the KAL Pure Stevia and it is the most natural form of Stevia.

I live in Hawaii where it is. To.  But I also pour over ice too.  I add honey to mine.  I add honey to my sleepy time.  I don't drink sleepy time any more since I got this.  I ha e drank a box already.  I think the trick is steeping the bag long enough.  At least 10 min I leave mine in.  I do use more water then 8oz.  I have a Keurig and I use the highest setting.  It almost fills a grande Starbucks cup...  I suggest this tea for sure to people who LIKE TEA!!!

It was $14.00 for approximately 8 ounces but had the most delicious texture, flavor, and consistency. Then I tried Native Forest which has guar gum but was definitely more affordable yet creamy and tasty. Then I bought Thai Kitchen and was extremely disappointed.  I assumed this was a well-known brand that prides itself on ethnic products and looked forward to testing in my coffee.  After refrigerating on opening the contents separated and became very hard, impossible to blend.  I ""sliced"" a few pieces and added some of the liquid and long gone was any hint of a coconut creamy concoction I experienced with the other two brands.  I then purchased the Blue Monkey version with a much larger can and it looks very mealy but tasty.

B0001LO3FG_9306	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"For some reason, known only to the powers that make such decisions, this bland, Twinings Prince of Wales Tea is not longer readily found on supermarket shelves.  You can still find it in variety packs, but It has been sometime since I have been able to find a whole box of the stuff.  That is a pity, but as I am what you might call a ""tea hoarder,"" I had two boxes in my stash and was rationing it slow out.  You can imagine my delight when I found you could purchase this product through Amazon!  Prince of Wales tea has a nice robust taste but no bitterness.  It is one of the few teas I can (if I so desire) drink without adding some sort of sweetener.  It never use mild or cream as my wife does, so for me that is a nice factor.  I simply like the flavor of this tea.  Twinings has been around (It is based in England) for a bit over 200 years now and there is a reason for this...they provide a fine quality product.  We are constantly trying new teas as we locate them, but it seems that over the years we keep coming back to this brand.  Now as has been noted by another reviewer here, this stuff is NOT packaged in England; it is packaged and distributed here in America.  This does not magically change the flavor of the tea though.  Tea is tea is tea.  Tea is NOT grown in England, so to say that tea that is packaged in England is better than that packaged in America is simply codwollop!  Yes, you might get ""stale"" tea here, but I doubt it. If you keep your tea under proper storage conditions, i.e. out of the light, no moisture and away from heat, it will last quite some time...I can assure you that the producers do this simply because they want to sell you the best tasting product possible. We in this country may not be as adept to brewing tea as our English brothers, but I doubt it.  No, the difference in the taste is more than likely all in the drinkers head.  The biggest problem I have and the biggest problem I have noted in our country when it comes to drinking tea made using tea bags is that we seem to be a very, very impatient people.  We simply do not, generally speaking of course, do not let it steep long enough.  A tea such as the one being reviewed here needs to steep no less that three minutes; preferably at least four.  I find myself getting in a bit of a hurry at times and end up drinking very weak and rather tasteless tea simply because I did not wait long enough.  Note:  Cost wise, this is on the rather high end for tea bag tea...in my opinion it is quite worth it though.  Anyway, enough of my babbling...this is a good tea.  Is it the only tea I drink or ever will drink?  Of course not.  3/4s of the fun of being a tea drinker is continuing throughout life trying different blends and brands.  I will say though that I most certainly have not grown tired of this stuff...yet.

I have never seen a printed ad or a tv commercial and I told them so. We have had a problem finding the product on the shelves at 3 different major grocery chain stores in this area for the past 7-8 years. I've had to keep asking the store managers to carry it and re-stock it. Two years ago I asked Kelloggs to put the stuffing mix back on the shelves and they told me to speak to the store manager! DURR!! We used it all year long for stuffed pork chops, chicken & turkey dishes, etc. Many times I would rather have this stuffing than mashed potatoes. We used this product for 40 years because it was the closest - without the fuss and mess - to the home-made-from-scratch stuffing my mom and Grandmother made.

B000EMRHWS_36030	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in. This one is jalepeno, which is my favorite. In fact it's the only flavor my wife & I can agree on (I also really like the Pizza flavor, but my wife hates them). Just goes to show you how different individual tastes vary.  But I do have mixed feelings about Just the Cheese - it's a genius idea. A convenient, single-serving bar of crispy cheese, to throw in your bag or glove box for a low carb snack. But 3 problems:  (1) Too much sodium. I have to guzzle a glass of water after eating a bar. And these are only 1/2 ounce!  (2) Taste isn't always consistent. Sometimes you get a burned piece.  (2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.  The Atkins & South Beach bars are much cheaper - usually 2.7-3.5 ounces (nearly 5-7 times more) for about the same price. I do not think this product should cost SIX TIMES what an Atkins bar costs.  These bars get a 3.5 stars for me. If the company would fix these problems, I'd give it a 5.  PS - If you like the idea of zero carb cheese snacks, you can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes:  Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown. A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450). And the great thing is, if you're a low carber who misses chips & dip, your homemade cheese crisps are easily dip-able in salsa, sour cream, etc.	 PS - If you like the idea of zero carb cheese snacks, you can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes:  Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown.	234:241	1311:1318	Just the Cheese Snack Bars,  Jalapeno Cheese, 15 - 0.5-Ounce Bars		easiest		have(e, EXPERIENCER=I, STIMULUS=kipper snacks)	use(e, THEME=types OF=hard cheese)	#1=THEME	difficulty	negative	y

B000DZDJ0K_27180	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"Celiac Disease is only a small percentage of symptoms from gluten allergies.  I knew I always had issues with eating bread, pizza, and pasta.  After many negative tests I finally got the positive result for Celiac disease....I wondered how three previous tests were negative.  Then, December 2012, my son went into anaphylaxis shock over gluten.  My son ate gluten for the first ten years of his life with no severe reactions.  Actually, no reactions.  The doctors had no real advice, no logical explanation for his new deadly reaction to gluten.  We have eli-pens everywhere now.  Answers:  If you think gluten makes you feel sluggish, tired, or your children seem pink under the eyes, over tired, sluggish and you can't put your finger on it.  You should take the 37 minutes and watch this movie on youtube named: ""gluten sensitivity vs. celiac disease vs. gluten intolerance"" by Glutenology.  The link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv5RwxYW8yA  This video changed my life and my understanding that was based on 1950's mentality.  Just watch it and if you think it doesn't apply to you or someone you love you just might be in denial.  Now back to Pamela's Baking mix.  It is hands down delicious.  It cooks well and my favorite is cooking it with banana slices and cinnamon in olive oil.  I've made an entire batch and ate them until I was sick.  However, before I knew it, my stomach had digested them, I felt great the next couple of days, and all body systems were normal.  Had I splurged on regular wheat pancakes I would have tossed and turned all night, bent over in pain, and no systems would have been working normally.  Since you are reading my review up to this point I think you just might be interested in my opinion.  So, this is it....feed this to your family instead of the regular gluten stuff.  You NEVER KNOW when your child could just suddenly have a deadly gluten allergy.  I have dreadful thoughts that we could have been camping miles from any help, with no Benadryl, no Epi-Pen, and my son's throat would have swollen shut.  Seriously, something is going on with our farming, our food, and children are suffering.  Maybe we started having issues as we grew up (obesity out of control, colon cancer huge killer) and we passed that irritation onto our children.  With each generation the reactions are more severe.  Gluten is the starch in the seed of grasses.  Corn is 55% while wheat is 68-69%.  That means your corn chips actually have gluten.  So many products claiming gluten free are not.  We learned by watching my son go into shock after eating them.  Pamela's is a solid brand with a solid product.  Never once has he had any reaction.  This gluten thing for us is LIFE AND DEATH, and last year at this time, we had NO IDEA, this year we would have this common food ingredient our deadliest enemy.  If you have children always keep an eye on rashes, swelling lips, hives, vomiting, red circles under their eyes, stomach aches, and itching.  Know the symptoms of an allergic reaction. AND ALWAYS carry liquid Benadryl with you.  Liquid matters when a reaction comes on and minutes matter.  Keep a bottle in your purse, you car, your camping kit, your hiking kit, at grandmas, and for sleep overs.  My son is alive because I learned in college how important Benadryl was and had it on hand.  We gave it to him and it helped keep him breathing until the ambulance arrived.  Message me if you are experiencing gluten allergies with your children or yourself.  My girlfriend and I are compiling information and stories for a book, youtube channel, and a blog.  It's something we are just starting and we know we won't be the first but with more information, stronger voices, maybe we can impact one family by helping them be prepared and save their child's life.  I have Pamela's stuff on Subscribe & Save with S'moreables, Anne's Gluten free Mac & Cheese, Enjoy Life Chocolate Chip cookies, and the list goes on. We get a case of 6 or more delivered every month.  It's the best way to do it and it's a BEST price.  Most of these items are 40% more in the health food stores.  This is not cheap stuff.  Indeed, it's worth every penny for my son to eat well, safely, and enjoy it.  I would love to personally thank Pamela's, Anne's, and all the other businesses that provide such quality products.  They have made my life as a mother easier and my son's life safer."

I finally found an outlet I could buy as cash, and got a 5# whole bean. But now the bag looked different and had ""gourmet"" on it... OK, it does taste great, so they ranked it, I thought. Opened it at home, and yes, good aroma. Brewed our first pot... hardly any scent in the kitchen... bland taste. What? Made a stronger pot...boring flavor! NOT THE FLAVOR we knew it to be!  So, I had to mix it with Sumatra or Costa Rica beans to use up 5# bag!!! I go there yesterday and ask for their freshest bag. I get it. Drive it to work, but NO SCENT ON THE CAR!! My car would smell like coffee for days, with the previous purchase. I thought it was my cold (why I could not smell it well). Opened it at home...yes good coffee smell. Brewed a pot...and STILL NOT LIKE THE OLD BREW! Had a nutty flavor. Wife was bloody upset! Had to go to McDonald's for her coffee. Ran to buy more Sumatra and Costa Rican coffee at T.J.s to save the day. STRIKE 2 for Farmer Bros. Went to the Donut shop. I see Supreme Plus on their brewer. I ask her. She says, ""no, get their cheapest brand, they have several types"". So, I am returning this BAD ""Gourmet"" IMITATION to the shop, and if they do not carry the old traditional packaged (beige with brown lettering), their CEO must have left or died, and so did their traditional blend.

B0009F3SDC_18685	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	I was kind of skeptical in believing that drinking a tea could actually make a difference so I was surprised with the results. Since I was feeling a bit sluggish and bloated I thought I would try it.  Just to start, I'm a 55 year old female, not on any medications.  I am currently on the off week of the detox.  Here's some of the things that happened to me after 4 weeks of drinking the tea once a day. 1.  Before the tea, I was getting headaches every other day, sometimes everyday.  They wouldn't last long, maybe an hour or 2 and I never took anything for them because they weren't that intense.  After 3 weeks of the tea, I wasn't getting headaches anymore.  This is the most significant change I've noticed. 2.  Before the tea, I was getting hot flashes every couple of hours, lasting maybe a minute or 2.  The result was that I had strong body odor in places I didn't know you could get body odor, my wrists and elbows, my belly, even the back of my knees, I would literally have to clean those areas several times a day and wear a light perfume.  While the tea didn't affect the intensity or frequency of the hot flashes, I noticed that I didn't have body odor at all anymore. 3.  Before the tea, I was mildly lactose intolerant.  The lactose pills worked very well for me, but after 3 weeks of the tea, I wasn't lactose intolerant anymore. 4.  Losing weight was not a motivation for my taking this tea as I'm not overweight but after the 3rd week I did find I lost 3 lbs. 5.  Having said that I lost weight, after the 3rd week, I was bloat free which helped my sluggishness. Some things to know: -  It's honestly not tasty - it tastes very herbal.  I added a couple dried prunes and some dried cranberries since those help your liver and kidneys.  It made it more tolerable. -  I drank it in the morning.  I found I couldn't sleep well if I drank at night, not because it has caffeine, but because I would have to go to the bathroom several times at night. -  I didn't have any noticeble skin or hair changes like others have reported, but I am not expecting to see any results until the 3rd or 4th month.  Hair and skin results can take a while to appear. -  Be patient - I didn't have any results until literally after the third week and keep in mind, they may not be results you would expect.  I wasn't expecting my headaches to go away. Hope this review helped you.

B000EMRHWS_36033	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in. This one is white cheddar pizza flavored, which I also liked.  You can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes: Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown. A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450). And the great thing is, if you're a low carber who misses chips & dip, your homemade cheese crisps are easily dip-able in salsa, sour cream, etc.  If you want to replicate the ""Just the Cheese"" flavor, take the package of powdered cheese from a box of ""white cheese"" flavored mac & cheese, and sprinkle it in. Therein lies the problem for me - wayyyy too much sodium. Cheese already has a lot of sodium. But add flavoring, and it can get overwhelming fast. After just one Just the Cheese bar, I have to guzzle a glass of water.  So I have mixed feelings - I think this product is a genius idea. A convenient, single-serving bar of crispy cheese, to throw in your bag or glove box for a low carb snack. But I grade it down for 3 reasons:  (1) Too much sodium. However, some of the other ""plain"" flavors have a bit less sodium.  (2) Taste isn't always consistent. Sometimes you get a burned piece.  (2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.  The Atkins & South Beach bars are much cheaper - usually 2.7-3.5 ounces (nearly 5-7 times more) for about the same price. I do not think this product should cost SIX TIMES what an Atkins bar costs.  3.5 stars for me. If the company would fix these problems, I'd give it a 5."

I'm normally more in favor of grinding my coffee beans fresh, and I still do for the French press, but it takes a very long time to grind coffee so fine, and the texture I can get from my grinder is not as perfect as the texture of this, which means that the resulting brew has the smooth texture that I've had when served to me at restaurants (even the finest setting on my grinder wasn't as even so it came out a little gritty, and it did not generate as much foam.)

B000GFYRK8_51529	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	I was very excited about this tisane, being an ardent fan of citrus fruits - I put a lemon slice in my water bottle every day. To say that this tea was a disappointment would be an understatement. I steeped this for four minutes, as per the instructions, while doing other chores and returned to find a nice rich orange-brown in my cup but, curiously, no fragrance at all to match. Even upon bringing this directly to your nose there is only the faintest whiff of lemon. Drinking it is worse: I thought there was something wrong with my senses after my first sip because there was no taste at all. After a few more attempts it got very, very slightly better - in that if you hold the tea in your mouth you might just be able to detect a bit of tartness, and you get a two-second aftertaste of something sour. But by and large this drink manages the amazing feat of somehow tasting blander than plain water. Save your money and buy some real lemons.

B000GARX3G_50189	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	"I do not buy the 5lb Nutiva any more since this is only a dollar less a pound. Any seed that I consume needs to be fresh since going rancid means worthless.  GENERAL: No, these will not make you high mentally but yet I get high physically since three tablespoon of this beauty, once again only 3 tablespoon which is 30 gr, offer me 50% magnesium and 25% zinc which allows me to get to really high spots in the mountains with my mountain bike or catch those big high waves in the ocean since my muscles do not cramp due to magnesium intake of hemp seeds. What an absolute joke, in US they continuously talk about health care but yet this one creation of nature which offers so much not only is not produced in US but yet the only site that I trust for ingredients which is the USDA Nutritional Value, will not offer me any info in regard to this superfood. Now you probably get an idea why so many industries controlling your dear representatives in US Senate will not allow hemp to have a chance to flourish in US. Big Pharma loves that idea since they sell those magnesium supplements which god knows what is in those unregulated tablets but yet citizens of US will not have access to the simple knowledge of all the minerals, vitamins, proteins and multitude of healthy hidden ingredients that this superfood offers at a reasonable price but yet they have all the nutritional value of Chia seeds which hardly has any vitamin or mineral but yet a whopping fiber at a whopping price since it is no threat to any industry in US... shame, shame, shame. While hemp and marijuana are kissing cousins, the amount of THC in hemp is almost non existent. Two tablespoons contains 400 milligrams of anti-inflammatory gamma-linolenic acid and 2 grams of omega-3 fats, plus all nine essential amino acids, compounds that help maximize recovery from workouts. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds ground in coffee maker+cocoa powder+unflavoured protein isolate, 4)hemp seeds, 5)watermelon & garlic on daily basis. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container then it needs to be #5 or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out. I consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which I consume food for, any food. Hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy. No gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat, in all energy bars which I never consume. Hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch, sugar or salt. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing any type of sport or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, dandelion, raw honey, garlic, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc...  MINERALS: Hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium, highest potassium, highest zinc and the healthiest fat.  .....................SESAME...FLAX....CHIA....AMARANTH....QUINOA..HEMP CALORIES.......565.........534......490......371.............368.........567 SAT FAT..........34...........18........16........7................4............17 CALCIUM.........99...........26........63........16..............5.............0 MAGNESIUM....89...........98.........0.........62..............49.............167 POTASSIUM.....14...........23..........5..........15..............16.............167 ZINC...............48...........29........23........19..............21..............83  FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.  FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16lb with 3.7"" (9.5cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chicken.  For 28gr/1oz servings size for peanut/almonds/chia/sesame/sunflower/cashew/flax accordingly; 167/137/160/162/155/150 total calories 27.3/21.9/50/26.8/31.2/34.4/33.0 from carbs 116/124/72.1/116/112/103/98.8 from fat 21.3/21.5/15.2/17.2/19.1/17.7/17.8 is from protein  For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's ""CARB CALORIES"" gain but 50% more ""FAT CALORIES"" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss. Sesame is my calcium but almonds are the superfood when it comes to fat calories and vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon, priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients vs. sesame. None offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so abandoned in all foods and not healthy at all. But, but, but, Hemp is the king for magnesium, potassium, zinc where is needed most for my muscle cramps and goes with all my work outs.  Organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available. The most harmful and deadly diseases plaguing America today are caused by food; cheap, low quality processed foods high in sugar, fat, salt, genetically modified ingredients and pesticides. when you reach for whole, nutrient-dense, organic foods, you get a food-remedy tool kit that not only will ward off cancer and heart disease, but also colds, flu, allergies, and a host of other ailments that plague us every day."

Swiss Knight Fondue is one of the two premier fondues that has survived the ""test of time"" and is of the highest quality.  I am in my sixties now but still enjoy this premiere fondue as long as I exercise to get the calories off and the LDLs out of my system!!!  That aside, I truly look forward to having this savory dish at least once every several weeks.  Back in the seventies, a lot of New York restaurants (especially those that were Swiss, of course) offered fondue. The prices rose from the tens to the twenties for a delicious pot of fondue and bread as the time expanded from the seventies into the eighties and eventually the nineties.  The price that Amazon offers is on the low-end and allows one to savor the exquisite taste of a marvelous meal for a fraction of what it would cost at any restaurant on the East or West Coast, or, for that matter, in-between.  I live in the Central States now but I can attest to the fact that a pot of Swiss Cheese Fondue in lower Wisconsin at a popular Swiss restaurant costs $22+ ... twice the purchase price of Swiss Knight fondue from Amazon !!!"

B000FNM5PU_47233	Reviews_Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food	The first few uses I was impressed. Let's just say we found lots of reasons to use these food dyes. I need them for things like icing cakes and cupcakes for birthdays, otherwise I end up at Whole Foods paying a good $35. We used all three colors with pretty good results. We made map-water blue, a pale green, and light-light-light red in buttercream.  The downside, and what I later found out by coming back to read the reviews, was that the dyes have a very short shelf life. Like a few short months. The dyes start separating (our red and yellow was already on the verge when we got it, turns out) and you won't get the same vibrancy.  Now, here's the saddest part. My daughter wanted a carrot cake for her birthday. So I thought, yeah, I can use white chocolate to make the carrot decorations. Got the white chocolate melted, got a decent but very pale green, added a bit more...and seized the chocolate. I went ahead and tried for orange (using the red and yellow of course) and was even more let down by how fast that seized. I managed to eke out a few passable carrots and used the green to write her name and age.  This product is for you if you are so tired of Whole Foods not sharing all their food dyes with you. I mean, why don't they carry dyes?? Why? Anyway, this does the job you'll need it for as long as you need it done quickly. For people like me who have children who can't comprehend why they can't have carrot decorations on their carrot cake, the price tag isn't a hindrance.

B000P0X15G_1564	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	Worst hat ever! I had high hopes after reading the reviews and seeing some children wearing this brand however to be honest my child would have as much protection wearing a knotted hanky on her head. Firstly it is so floppy so the slightest breeze and the whole thing just flies up and back off the face/head. The tie at the back to fit the hat a little more securely to the head didn't work this is in part because the cord that is only half way round the head is thin so does not 'grip' the head in anyway. I think an elastic section would have been better. The depth of the actual head part could also be slightly deeper - I bought my just 2 year old the 2-4 size and it felt a bit small and she's an average size. Overall just a waste of money.

While lab created, this stone really does change colours in daylight and by candlelight, in soft light and under pot lights. It is a beautiful deep eggplant purple in regular light, changes to a raspberry in different light and has blue/green undertones in different light. The setting is unique with the emerald cut alexandrite turned on its side to be a diamond shape, and the double prongs at each corner are stunning but still lend to simplicity which lets the colour and size of this stone shine through. At 2.75 carats it's not overwhelming in size but is small enough to look ""genuine"" and not just a cocktail ring.

B00OXS7QNY_13586	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	Surprisingly adorable! I wasn't expecting much based on the price point and some of the reviews but wanted a black jacquard skirt and took a chance. The pleats fall really well and the high waistband has a great fit. Of course the fabric isn't the greatest quality but the jacquard pattern is quite pretty and actually has the surprising effect of making the fabric look elegant and higher end, especially when paired with a good top/accessories. It runs extremely small. Am normally a size 2 in skirts with fitted waistbands; I ordered a large and it was perfect. Snug at the waist with some volume in the skirt.  Love it!!!

B000PHANNM_1730	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	Our youngest family member looks adorable in his new flap sun protection hat. He kept it on his head when we tried it on him and just grinned at us. After a little while, he took it off and examined it carefully. It was somewhat hysterical to see him eyeballing his new hat. It seems that our boy is going to be somewhat of a redhead so he will need this type of head gear when he is out in the sun, I think. He really did look cute in it and the drawstring in the back will make it smaller or larger as needed. I think he will be able to wear it for a long time. I was very pleased with this purchase and so was his mother. I think it is just as cute as could be. I am glad we bought it. Five stars.

B014F5ZCQ2_37237	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	I bought this for $17.99 as a birthday gift for a relative because I have a cat kigurumi myself and share it with her to sleep in.

B01CWR022Y_42594	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	I'm a big fan of the open cardigan concept.  Not only are they stylish and cute, they also keep me warm in our frigid offices at work. The black one I've had for years has been looking worn and pilled for a while now, so I bought this one online at a discount for my honest and unbiased review to replace it.  Here are my thoughts on this Elain & J Long Sleeve Open Cardigan:  IT'S THIN The material is very thin, much thinner than I expected. If held to the light, it is see-through. This can be a pro or con -- it's doesn't keep me as warm, but then again it's also not too heavy when I just need something light covering me.  THE TAILS ARE LONG The woman in the model picture must have a very long torso. The longest part (the front) of the garment comes down just a few inches above my knee.  It covers my rear in the back as well. I ordered a small and am 5 feet tall.  IT'S SHEDDING? I've only had this cardigan for a few days, but I noticed today that I had tiny black pieces of fabric on my pants.  I rubbed the cardigan in my hands and sure enough, I had a small amount of fabric shedding in my hands. Maybe this goes away after a few washes?  Overall, I like it -- it serves the purpose I need for work and it goes well with everything.  I wish it was a little bit better quality, but I plan to keep wearing it either way.

B002IYKIOY_4227	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	"This fits me well enough that I am happy, especially at this price-point. I'm lucky that I could try it on in a store to see the actual fit before purchasing. Because this lower-end item fits me fine, I will look into trying this brand's higher-end women's clothing in the future. I rated it 4/5 stars at this point because I don't yet know how the fabric and construction will hold up under heavy use and washing. [SEE update below.]  - Get the size that fits your full bust measurement, even if you are above a UK G-cup. It will be the best size for you; anything smaller will be too small in the bust. I am a UK 34GG/H and the XL does not pull across my bust unless I put my shoulders back completely.* This is cut for movement, but if you are a properly-sized A- through C-cup and always have problems with your shoulders being too large for your clothing, consider sizing up; I would not normally suggest this, but you need to make sure you can move in this if you're cooking.  - Do a search for UNCOMMON THREADS clothing elsewhere to find their sizing charts - do not rely on the standard Amazon sizing by bust measurement or you will probably end up purchasing something that is too large for you. (I suspect that reviewers who said the size they bought was too big probably went by standard Amazon women's top sizing by bust measurement.)  - The listing right now says it has cloth-covered buttons, but you can see from the picture they are the plastic pearl-type, not cloth.  - The sleeve on me is ridiculously long, but that is typical since I have to size up for my bust and the assumption is if you're bigger around, your arms are longer. When I fold up the full cuff, the sleeves are about bracelet-length on me.  - Similarly, the overall length is too long for me, but because of the side slits, it fits fine over my hips. I will probably shorten the length and may/may not move the side-slit origin up.  - The extra ease in the overall garment and in the back doesn't really bother me in this jacket; since I will be moving a lot when using it, the extra space is appropriate.  *Specifically: My bust measures 45"" at the fullest, but at my full bustline, the front/back ratio is 26/19. The armscye is too large and cuts too far forward on my body, due to the back being too wide and the front being too narrow for my shape. When I put my shoulders back completely, the front pulls a little and the back is wrinkled. In regular use, it it loose enough that this doesn't pose a problem for me, especially since, when cooking, my arms will mostly be forward. If you are a UK H-cup or higher, you may have more of a problem with this front/back proportion problem, depending on your bustline vertical fullness and other things like vertical torso proportions and boob placement.  FYI: I have problems with commercially-sized clothing fitting my body shape due to a proportionately larger bust and shorter torso and overall body height.  ------------------------------------------------------- Update: It has performed incredibly well, cleans easily in the wash, and looks exactly the same as it did when I got it. I changed my rating to 5 stars.  I wasn't sure about the 65/35 poly/cotton fabric, but, so far, the easy-clean and no-iron-needed aspects are far outweighing the slightly less breathable, slightly hotter-wearing negatives. The only improvement I can see is if they offered it in different curviness sizes like Pepperberry or BiuBiu or similar stores."

B01BE5S1CS_41463	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	"My first experience with Boxy was the very affordable, but very unattractive, cube-looking ""Boxy Winder"" as they called it, which was also marketed under other brand names.  It had an awful fake carbon fiber print front, with a large submarine bubble cover.  But, it was affordable, small, and able to stack with other Boxy Winders, so I wound up getting more, especially since it performed flawlessly at the most important task -- silently keeping my watch wound.  Since then, I see they have the ""Fancy Brick"" now, which is kind of an upgraded version of the original cube, plus this new series, the Castle Series, which I think is just about the best winder on the market and the fact that it's hundreds less than other winders that don't even look this good is just amazing, and my hat is off to Boxy on this winning design.  I did not buy it here, because it wasn't on Amazon yet, but seeing it here now, I wanted to leave a review for other folks looking for a good winder.  With a small collection of various Swiss automatics, I have bought a number of winders over the years, and always I'd rather spend less where possible, so I have more money for more watches!  But a winder has to do the job.  I've had some good luck with Heiden, Belocia, even Chiyoba, and of course I love my Wolf Winder, but to date this really about the best winder I've purchased, and the price is really stunning for what you get.  This is a hardwood, matte finish, beautiful piece of furniture, with a glass cover that glides down on soft touch hinges.  The interior is finished in black and the clean, modern design is incredibly attractive.  They aren't trying to fancy it up, just keeping it simple and streamlined, and the result that it looks far more expensive than what you paid, and avoids the ""budget"" look of inexpensive winders that try to save money with plastic lids, fake stitched leather and overly glossed veneer finishes.  So, if you are looking for a winder you can be proud to display, this is the one, and your watches look great shining out from the dark interior (which very effectively highlights your watches as the main attraction).  And, speaking of shining out -- this has LIGHTS!!!  Yup, two LED's inside light up your beautiful time pieces whenever it feels vibration, such as opening the cover.  And yes, you can turn those off, with a simple push of a button.  If there is any tiny drawback to this model, at all, it is probably that the controls are recessed into the front of the unit, and are a bit difficult to reach, for initial set up.  That's a very minor thing though, compared to everything that is so outstanding about this winder and it's not an area you need to access more than once anyway.  Movement is absolutely silent, the watch holding mechanism is simple but effective, with a very firm foam pillow that fits snugly into the cradle, holding your watch very secure.  Another great feature?  Like other Boxy winders, it always returns your watch to an upright position, meaning the twelve faces to the top, so after each winding cycle, both of your watches face upright.  With a four pin switch system, there are a ton of variations for turns per day, in whatever direction you choose, so this also scores big points for being suitable for just about any watch on earth.  Fit and finish certainly matches or even beats winders four or five times more expensive and it excels where it matters most, in keeping your watches steadily and quietly wound.

B00I1QJ2BS_32738	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	When you open it up, there are three sections; one for your cards, which there are two slot areas. The second section consist of a zipper section with two sides inside. To me, this is the most secure area becuase of the zipper for money and coins. The last section in the back is where your phone can be stored. However, I don't use it for that. I just put coupons and other things back there. Be aware the section is not very secure. So, if you put change back there, it will fall out from the little spaces below.  I've had this wallet for about half a year and it STILL looks very good. There are no tears and wears. I got mines from EBAY for around 5 bucks, free shipping.  2/14/14 Update I did discover that even from the middle zipper section, some coins can still slip from under and into the back area. Ugh. Anyway, It's best to get a little coin pouch you can hook it up with then to rely on coins for this wallet.  2/15/14 While I was in the store, my coins kept falling out onto the floor. Sometimes we're very quick with shoving stuff in our wallets, but this lets you know that the back part of the wallet is VERY unreliable for coins. Just wanted to point that out.

B016YEK1X6_38726	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	After moving back to the Northwest from the Southwest I was decidedly short on winter gear. When I was offered the opportunity to review this cute looking wool blend hat for a discount I was very excited. The hat arrived quickly and well packaged. As soon as I pulled it out of the package, my hopes fell. This hat feels cheap. The yarn is not soft but not heavy either. The fleece on the inside is decent but pretty thin and it only covers about 3 inches of the bottom of the hat. For another .04$ or so they could have covered the entire inside with fleece and had a fairly warm hat but the stitch on top is loose enough that it doesn't stop the wind so the top of your head is cold while your ears are warmish. The hat is also really long so you either pull it all the way down practically covering your eyes or you wear it up and have unflattering cone head. It's definitely not the worst hat I have ever seen but for 25$ this thing should be amazing quality and it just isn't. I hate leaving bad reviews, in fact, I have done hundreds of reviews and there are only a handful of 3 stars but I couldn't in good conscience tell people that this hat is worth the money when it isn't. If I had paid full price I would be mad and the hat would be going back.

B00HJZL7HE_28317	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	Let's be honest, Your looking to buy this product to do one of the following: give your body a nice shape, try to flatten your tummy, shed a few inches off your waist, or even posture. Hell, Maybe even all of them . I'm here to honestly tell you how your experience will be with this cincher.  **Please remember cinchers are different than corsets. Corsets are made for more serious waist training.  Posture: I have been using this product for about a week and a half and with it on notice a change in my posture. Mostly because with it on it is uncomfortable to really slouch. Uncomfortable, not unbearable. You most likely sit straighter because the bones in it are plastic and you might break them doing some dramatic moves. I've noticed I walk taller and sit straighter with it on.  Sizing: Based on other reviews I'm sure you notice there is a lot of issues when it comes to choosing the correct size due to the inconsistency. I'm going to try my best to make this as simple as possible. I am a 36C/D bra size. When wearing women's T-shirts I am a Medium (Men's Small) and in dresses I am most comfortable in an 8. The reviews told me to order 2 sizes up so I did, buying  an extra-large (XL).  How it Fit: The first time I ever used the cincher I was able to put it on the tightest setting (second row). Ideally you want to first be able to put it on the loosest setting (1st row) then graduate to the second you know it's working and that your waist may be getting smaller. I may have been better off getting a large. I have ordered another cincher and this time a Large. As far as the initial size I bought (XL) it's not too tight even on the second setting . When I say not too tight, I mean that I can breathe in it . I do feel compression and it does flatten me out but I'd rather have a large just for my preference so keep that in mind. I will say that the XL for me starting off on the second setting was probably a good starting point seeing as though I never typically wear cinchers or corsets.  Gym Use: So far I have used this cincher in the gym. It was not uncomfortable even when sitting down and doing floor exercises. It does give compression allowing for proper use and that little extra something to work your abs . In comparison to a typical exercise bandits does not collect a lot of sweat so it's not extra gross when taking it off after a workout.  Body Shaping: Okay, I'm sure this is where many of you jumped down to. Trust me, this was all I was searching for in reviews. So this cincher actually does give the appearance of a flatter tummy and smaller waist under my clothes, but it is NOT a dramatic difference. I bought this to introduce my tummy and waist to the idea of waist training ( if these are your intentions, this product is a good place to start) HOWEVER, if you are seeking a product to begin serious waist training, it is best to begin with a steel boned corset. This cincher easily takes away 1-2 inches of your waist. May be another inch or two more but I would need a smaller size to be sure. Does give a more flattering appearance under your clothes and active wear at the gym ,  Body Results: Like I have stated previously, I have only had the product after a week in a half. So far, I have seen a slight difference. I'm not sure if it's just when I take it off because everything still seems to be sitting in the right place. But I do feel like I'm pinching less when touching poking and my sides. The current results make me optimistic about future results so I will keep using  Flaws: I can see the cincher hooks through my clothes. I would not recommend wearing with skin tight apparel. If you bend the bones they will snap. Since I have a relatively short torso this cincher meets my bra sometimes pushing in my underwire which is sometimes uncomfortable.  Welp, that's pretty much all I have. If you have any additional comments or questions feel free to contact me at genee143@comcast.net .  I am not paid or anything I just know how hard it is to find honest thorough reviews. I am not sure if amazon has a messaging center but if they do you can message me there as well. Happy Cinching!	 How it Fit: The first time I ever used the cincher I was able to put it on the tightest setting (second row).	80:88	1279:1287	Ann Michell Classic Waist Cincher (40, Beige)		tightest		second row	settings OF=waist cincher	settings	tightness	positive	y

These are the most comfortable(for a tight fit in a climbing shoe) and have the stiffest fore foot. Because of the stiffness of the shoe you don't lose power when you size them for comfort. And yes, with that stiffness, you probably lose a little sensitivity. I would compare the rubber to Vibrams Edge. I wear a 11.5/12 street shoe and have morton's toe. These are a size 12 and are really snug but not screaming, toes curled tight. For an all day trad fit I'd probably go with a 13. While I prefer a lace shoe, I am happy with the velcro straps.

B01B42F9V2_41293	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	"I disagree with it saying that it's ""plus sized"" when they only offer the largest as an 8/10 and actual ""plus size"" begins at 16 typically.  I am a size 12, but I thought I would give this suit a try because I have been in need of a one piece suit for swimming.  Bikinis just aren't made for active swimming! I struggle with finding a decent fitting one piece suit because I'm tall - and it's nearly impossible to find something at a low price that isn't giving me an epic weggie or cameltoe because it's made for shorter people, so that is super frustrating. It's not something you find on the rack for 20-30 bucks at your big box stores and I'm not looking to drop over 100 bucks on a suit I just want for functionality. This suit works for what I am looking for, although I would prefer the shoulder straps would cross over in the back so that I could be sure they wouldn't slide off my shoulders while I'm swimming, although that hasn't happened yet so it could be OK, just something that concerns me a little. So - while it is not technically a plus size, it's got enough give in the 8/10 size to fit me as a 12.  The bust is a great fit (I'm a 36DD), and the best part of this suit for me is that it is for a Long Torso (I'm 5'10""). I picked out the dark blue and black suit and it is the same color as pictured on the site.  It's not a ""slimming"" suit, so if you have a tummy pouch, you're probably still going to see it a little because it doesn't hold it in for you, but because of the style it is more flattering than other one piece suits. The material is similar to other swimsuits, not too thin that it seems flimsy or cheaply made. The top does have some padding to maintain your modestly. The bottom cut is very modest as well, full coverage of the cheeks and not high-cut in the hips either. Modesty isn't my main purpose of buying this suit, but for those who are looking for something modest it would be a good choice. I only rated it a 4-star because it is not technically a Plus Size suit, but everything else is pretty spot on. I received this product at a discounted price or for free in exchange for an honest review."

B01CZE60V6_20934	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	This is an incredible buy!  All three bags are wonderful on their own, and to have the whole set is so much better!  The large purse is great for those times when I carry a book with me to appointments.  It's roomy enough for everything I need to carry, and it's so stylish!  The medium sized bag is my everyday bag.  I use the large strap to make it a cross-body bag.  It carries my essentials and goes everywhere with me.  The smallest bag is great for those times when I need to run out to grab something and don't need to carry much with me.  Or I can use it for a few essentials to tuck inside the large bag!  So many ways to use them and they are beautiful and soft to the touch.  Gorgeous colors and very feminine.  I love them all!

B01HAW5GMC_46110	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	This dress is so gorgeous! I was honestly expecting something of less quality because of the price, the location it was shipping from and the material. But, I am so surprised to have a unique and fun dress to wear to an upcoming Dr. Seuss themed event. I ordered style A001, with the paint splashes on the front and back. The white material is so gorgeous. It has an embossed look and is basically off-white on white paisley pattern. My Honey says the white reminds him of upholstery but I love it because it reminds me of old Gunny Sack dresses. The colors are more varied and much more vibrant than the photo does it justice. The splash of color on the front goes above and below the waist seam. There is a splash of color on the back but it is smaller and only from the waist seam down. It is lovely. The material is really soft, but it is very firm and has no stretch. I went by the measurements listed in the product photos and that made me the largest size available, a size 8. (I laid down one of my favorite dresses that is similar and measured the dress like the product description instructed.) I am usually a 4-6 in dresses so this was surprising. Now, I have a history of buying Amazon clothing from China and the sizes almost always run really small compared to US sizes, so I was not alarmed at ordering an 8. It took a really long time to get here, but I ordered many months in advance of the event. I think it took about a month. I arrived folded up but still neat considering how far it traveled. The fit is absolutely perfect on me and fits to my measurements!! I am so happy that this is a successful purchase because this dress is the absolute perfect dress for my event. I am a colorful person and this is going to really highlight that part of me and make me feel like a trendsetter with it's uniqueness. I plan to dry clean the dress to give it a seamless shape and then I will be wearing a light, white petticoat underneath. This will fill out the billowy skirt, add some length and hide my undercarriage when I bend over. *wink* This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon ever. I will come back and attach photos of it laying flat and being worn. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When I shop on Amazon, I rely heavily on the reviews of others to make my purchasing decisions. Because of this, I try to always leave a helpful or informative review.

B01DTQALBO_21302	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	Im a personal stylist, Ive looked for comfy pjs everywhere- and Ive finally found them! I used to buy silk pjs from Victorias Secret. In comparison, this companies pjs are a lot softer & give that luxurious feel. I haven't washed them yet, so Im not sure what the quality is. I plan on washing them carefully by hand. For reference: Im 55, 105 lbs and I ordered a size SMALL in the light grey color (which has purple undertones) Typically I order size xs because Im very petite, but small is the best fit for these measurements because the pant legs are a short. If you're looking for lose fitting silk pjs to lounge in, ORDER 1 SIZE UP.  Im ordering a second pair of these pjs today, just in case they ever go out of stock. I highly recommend the color I ordered- has expensive, classy feel & looks great on any skin tone.

B01B5WIXJ6_41325	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	The Pros: - Comfort fit band, very comfortable! - Delicate looking, I love the 3mm width - Pretty color difference from the usual blacks, silvers, and yellow golds - All CZ sparkly, clear, and accounted for - I think it just plain looks pretty - STAINLESS STEEL. Will NOT turn your skin green like silver rings with a higher nickel filler content. - Unique, and definitely affordable  The Cons: - Ever so slightly darker color than the typical pinky pale rose gold. The actual color of the ring I received is closer to the copper tone of a new US penny.  3mm Stainless Steel Thin Prong Cubic Zirconia Wedding Ring Bands for Men and Women, Gold/black/rose Why choose Stainless steel Jewerly? Stainless steel has become an increasingly popular metal choice for fashion jewelry, because of it's bright,silvery finish and its resistance to tarnish, Excellent Durability etc. It not like silver will be getting black,not like copper jewelry allergy prone, not as alloy jewelry because of lead. Stainless steel jewelry is Fade-resistant,No Rust, Anti-allergy. I received my ring in the mail about an hour ago, and have been wearing it since. I find it pleasant to wear, due to the inner rim of the band, which is designed a comfort fit - this means the inside is rounded slightly, which leaves no edges to dig into your skin when you move your fingers at the wrong angle (and though this one is just my opinion, I find it also suspends the band ever so slightly above your skin so that it allows the skin under it to breathe a little better and not chafe). I love comfort fit bands, and am pleased that this one is.  The color of the rose gold is slightly darker than I expected, and if I had any cons about this ring it would be this: the color is a bit closer to a light copper in my opinion, and while I note this with a mild disappointment, it's still quite beautiful. The CZ gems are clear, sparkling, and a bright white; they are set without visible prongs into the band, and while I wonder if they will hold up to every day life and the test of time, the ring IS made of steel, so I would hope that will mean that they will remain there. None are missing as of receiving the ring, so we're off to a good start!  It's a very simple and classy ring, and I think that it fits well. It feels like these are true to size. The band doesn't feel too wide or thick to me, and I do like that this is stainless steel. I really can't say more about it other than this is super cute, and I'm very glad I got this!!

Find one for your lover.  This is a nice small ring. The only downside is that the band is kind of thick, and the edges are squared off so it's going to take a bit of getting used to.

B012ZQR84C_17591	Reviews_AMAZON_FASHION	"I ordered three totally different bags to compare for airline travel (at my own expense, none provided free). They all have their perks, and you can find my other reviews on Travelon and neatpack (medium toiletry bag) product sites on Amazon.  I love the way this Sakroots ""Artist Circle Critter Travel Bag"" looks. It is a really attractive pattern and will admit the primary reason I purchased it. As far as functionality,  the neatpack medium toiletry bag was best for airline travel (ordered two of them;  one for packing in carry-on suitcase & one for college student who has to share a bathroom). The leopard print Travelon was the best quality, made the best use of its space and held the most toiletries (even full-size bottles upright) for non-airline travel.

HarryPotter_9_16	literature	CHAPTER ONE The Boy Who Lived Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone By J.K.

They were the last people you ’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious , because they just did n’t hold with such nonsense . Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings , which made drills . He was a big , beefy man with hardly any neck , although he did have a very large mustache . Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck , which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences , spying on the neighbors . The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere . The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it .

The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street . The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son , too , but they had never even seen him . This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away ; they did n’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that . When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull , gray Tuesday our story starts , there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country .

There were no photographs of them in the house . When he had been younger , Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away , but it had never happened ; the Dursleys were his only family . Yet sometimes he thought ( or maybe hoped ) that strangers in the street seemed to know him . Very strange strangers they were , too . A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley .

One day in July , Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform , leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s . Mrs. Figg was n’t as bad as usual . It turned out she ’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats , and she did n’t seem quite as fond of them as before . She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she ’d had it for several years . That evening , Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand- new uniform . Smeltings ’ boys wore maroon tailcoats , orange knickerbockers , and flat straw hats called boaters .

He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head , pull rugs from under your feet , pelt you with bits of chalk , or sneak up behind you , invisible , grab your nose , and screech , “ GOT YOUR CONK ! ” Even worse than Peeves , if that was possible , was the caretaker , Argus Filch . Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning . Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor . He would n’t believe they were lost , was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose , and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell , who was passing . Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris , a scrawny , dust-colored creature with bulging , lamp like eyes just like Filch ’s . She patrolled the corridors alone . Break a rule in front of her , put just one toe out of line , and she ’d whisk off for Filch , who ’d appear , wheezing , two seconds later .

Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for . Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only one taught by a ghost . Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him . Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up . Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk . At the start of their first class he took the roll call , and when he reached Harry ’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight . Professor McGonagall was again different . Harry had been quite right to think she was n’t a teacher to cross . Strict and clever , she gave them a talking -to the moment they sat down in her first class . “ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ” she said . “ Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back .	“ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ” she said .	33:37	1310:1314			most		Transfiguration	magics	magics	complexity	positive	n

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they 'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place . And some said that even the trees had been a bad move , and that no one should ever have left the oceans . And then , one Thursday , nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change , one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time , and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place . This time it was right , it would work , and no one would have to get nailed to anything . Sadly , however , before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it , a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred , and the idea was lost forever . This is not her story . But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences . It is also the story of a book , a book called The Hitch Hiker 's Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book , never published on Earth , and until the terrible catastrophe occurred , never seen or heard of by any Earthman . Nevertheless , a wholly remarkable book . In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard either .

Guide_28_7	literature	In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy , the Hitch Hiker 's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom , for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal , or at least wildly inaccurate , it scores over the older , more pedestrian work in two important respects . First , it is slightly cheaper ; and secondly it has the words Do n't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover . But the story of this terrible , stupid Thursday , the story of its extraordinary consequences , and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply . It begins with a house . 1 The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village . It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland . Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty years old , squattish , squarish , made of brick , and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye . The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent , and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in . He had lived in it for about three years , ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable . He was about thirty as well , dark haired and neverquite at ease with himself . The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about . He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought .

It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold - mostly humanoid , but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers , two or three green slyph - like maximegalacticans , an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo ( a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue ) . All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats ; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion .

Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it . Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job . The crowd gasped , dazzled by sun and seemanship , as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay . It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns . In fact it did n't need to touch the water at all , because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water . They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air , carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat 's wake as it careered across the bay . Zaphod loved effect : it was what he was best at . He twisted the wheel sharply , the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves .

One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him , and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket . Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle , split , and slowly folded itself down into the ground .

It was discovered by a lucky chance , and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government 's research team on Damogran . This , briefly , is the story of its discovery . The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 SubMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer ( say a nice hot cup of tea ) were of course well understood - and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess 's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left , in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy . Many respectable physicists said that they were n't going to stand for this - partly because it was a debasement of science , but mostly because they did n't get invited to those sort of parties . Another thing they could n't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mindparalysing distances between the furthest stars , and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible .

The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries . In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness . All his heirs are now long dead , and this means that without any drastic political upheaval , power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder , and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly . In fact it vests in no such place . The President in particular is very much a figurehead - he wields no real power whatsoever . He is apparently chosen by the government , but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage . For this reason the President is always a controversial choice , always an infuriating but fascinating character . His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it . On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud . Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all , and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded .

Hobbit_7_1	literature	Chapter I. An Unexpected Party In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit . Not a nasty , dirty , wet hole , filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell , nor yet a dry , bare , sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat : it was a hobbit-hole , and that means comfort . It had a perfectly round door like a porthole , painted green , with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle . The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel : a very comfortable tunnel without smoke , with panelled walls , and floors tiled and carpeted , provided with polished chairs , and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors . The tunnel wound on and on , going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill , as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors opened out of it , first on one side and then on another . No going upstairs for the hobbit : bedrooms , bathrooms , cellars , pantries ( lots of these ) , wardrobes ( he had whole rooms devoted to clothes ) , kitchens , dining -rooms , all were on the same floor , and indeed on the same passage . The best rooms were all on the left - hand side ( going in ) , for these were the only ones to have windows , deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond , sloping down to the river . This hobbit was a very well - to - do hobbit , and his name was Baggins . The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind , and people considered them very respectable , not only because most of them were rich , but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected : you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him .

I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays , since they have become rare and shy of the Big People , as they call us . They are ( or were ) a little people , about half our height , and smaller than the bearded Dwarves . Hobbits have no beards . There is little or no magic about them , except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along , making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off . They are inclined to be at in the stomach ; they dress in bright colours ( chiefly green and yellow ) ; wear no shoes , because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads ( which is curly ) ; have long clever brown fingers , good-natured faces , and laugh deep fruity laughs ( especially after dinner , which they have twice a day when they can get it ) . Now you know enough to go on with . As I was saying , the mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins , that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took , one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took , head of the hobbits who lived across The Water , the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill . It was often said ( in other families ) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife . That was , of course , absurd , but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit - like about them , - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures . They discreetly disappeared , and the family hushed it up ; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses , though they were undoubtedly richer . Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins . Bungo , that was Bilbo 's father , built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her ( and partly with her money ) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water , and there they remained to the end of their days . Still it is probable that Bilbo , her only son , although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father , got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side , something that only waited for a chance to come out .

It was often said ( in other families ) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife . That was , of course , absurd , but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit - like about them , - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures . They discreetly disappeared , and the family hushed it up ; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses , though they were undoubtedly richer . Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins . Bungo , that was Bilbo 's father , built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her ( and partly with her money ) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water , and there they remained to the end of their days . Still it is probable that Bilbo , her only son , although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father , got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side , something that only waited for a chance to come out . The chance never arrived , until Bilbo Baggins was grown up , being about fifty years old or so , and living in the beautiful hobbit - hole built by his father , which I have just described for you , until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably . By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world , when there was less noise and more green , and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous , and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes ( neatly brushed ) - Gandalf came by . Gandalf ! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him , and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear , you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale . Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went , in the most extraordinary fashion . He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages , not since his friend the Old Took died , in fact , and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like .

"" With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door , and shut it as quickly as he dared , not to seen rude . Wizards after all are wizards . "" What on earth did I ask him to tea for ! "" he said to himself , as he went to the pantry . He had only just had break fast , but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright . Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door , and laughing long but quietly . After a while he stepped up , and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit 's beautiful green front-door . Then he strode away , just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very well . The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf He did not remember things very well , unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet : like this : GANDALF TEA WEDNESDAY . Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind . Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front- door bell , and then he remembered ! He rushed and put on the kettle , and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two , and ran to the door . "" I am so sorry to keep you waiting ! "" he was going to say , when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all . It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt , and very bright eyes under his dark - green hood . As soon a the door was opened , he pushed inside , just as if he had been expected . He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg , and "" Dwalin at your service ! "" he said with a low bow . "" Bilbo Baggins at yours ! "" said the hobbit , too surprised to ask any questions for the moment . When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable , he added : "" I am just about to take tea ; pray come and have some with me .

"" He had only just had a sip - in the corner , while the four dwarves sat around the table , and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins , and the depredations of dragons , and lots of other things which he did not understand , and did not want to , for they sounded much too adventurous - when , DIING - DONG -A-LING - DANG , his bell rang again , as if some naughty little hobbit - boy was trying to pull the handle off .

Hobbit_412_15	literature	"Dragons steal gold and jewels , you know , from men and elves and dwarves , wherever they can find them ; and they guard their plunder as long as they live ( which is practically forever , unless they are killed ) , and never enjoy a brass ring of it . Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad , though they usually have a good notion of the current market value ; and they ca n't make a thing for themselves , not even mend a little loose scale of their armour . There were lots of dragons in the North in those days , and gold was probably getting scarce up there , with the dwarves flying south or getting killed , and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse . There was a most specially greedy , strong and wicked worm called Smaug . One day he flew up into the air and came south . The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North , and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind . Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside ( I was one luckily - a fine adventurous lad in those days , always wandering about , and it saved my life that day ) - well , from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame . Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire . By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming . The dwarves rushed out of their great gate ; but there was the dragon waiting for them . None escaped that way . The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale , and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors - the usual unhappy story , it was only too common in those days . Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls , and lanes , and tunnels , alleys , cellars , mansions and passages . After that there were no dwarves left alive inside , and he took all their wealth for himself . Probably , for that is the dragons ' way , he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside , and sleeps on it for a bed . Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale , and carry away people , especially maidens , to eat , until Dale was ruined , and all the people dead or gone . What goes on there now I do n't know for certain , but I do n't suppose anyone lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake nowadays . "" The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding , and cursed Smaug ; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards . They looked very grim but they said very little . When I asked how they had got away , they told me to hold my tongue , and said that one day in the proper time I should know .

Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell . The air grew warmer as they got lower , and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy , so that every now and again he nodded and nearly fell off , or bumped his nose on the pony 's neck .

"" And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House , and found its doors flung wide . Now it is a strange thing , but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about , and not much to listen to ; while things that are uncomfortable , palpitating , and even gruesome , may make a good tale , and take a deal of telling anyway . They stayed long in that good house , fourteen days at least , and they found it hard to leave . Bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever - even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble . Yet there is little to tell about their stay . The master of the house was an elf-friend - one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History , the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North . In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors , and Elrond the master of the house was their chief . He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord , as strong as a warrior , as wise as a wizard , as venerable as a king of dwarves , and as kind as summer . He comes into . many tales , but his part in the story of Bilbo 's great adventure is only a small one , though important , as you will see , if we ever get to the end of it . His house was perfect , whether you liked food , or sleep , or work , or story - telling , or singing , or just sitting and thinking best , or a pleasant mixture of them all . Evil things did not come into that valley . I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that they heard in that house . All of them , the ponies as well , grew refreshed and strong in a few days there . Their clothes were mended as well as their bruises , their tempers and their hopes . Their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes . Their plans were improved with the best advice .

Hobbit_932_10	literature	" I could not say ,  said Elrond , "" but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other plunderers , or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains of the North . I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria , since the dwarf and goblin war . "" Thorin pondered these words . "" I will keep this sword in honour , "" he said . "" May it soon cleave goblins once again ! "" "" A wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains ! "" said Elrond . "" But show me now your map ! "" He took it and gazed long at it , and he shook his head ; for if he did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold , he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness , and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale and its merry bells , and the burned banks of the bright River Running . The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent . He held up the map and the white light shone through it . "" What is this ? "" he said . "" There are moon-letters here , beside the plain runes which say ' five feet high the door and three may walk abreast . ' "" "" What are moon-letters ? "" asked the hobbit full of excitement . He loved maps , as I have told you before ; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting , though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery . "" Moon- letters are rune-letters , but you cannot see them , "" said Elrond , "" not when you look straight at them . They can only be seen when the moon shines behind them , and what is more , with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written . The dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens , as your friends could tell you . These must have been written on a midsummer 's eve in a crescent moon , a long while ago . "" "" What do they say ?

Hobbit_1021_25	literature	So they spread out their wet things on the floor , and got dry ones out of their bundles ; then they made their blankets comfortable , got out their pipes and blew smoke rings , which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them . They talked and talked , and forgot about the storm , and discussed what each would do with his share of the treasure ( when they got it , which at the moment did not seem so impossible ) ; and so they dropped off to sleep one by one . And that was the last time that they used the ponies , packages , baggages , tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them . It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with them , after all . For somehow , he could not go to sleep for a long while ; and when he did sleep , he had very nasty dreams . He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger , and opened wider and wider , and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look . Then he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way , and he was slipping - beginning to fall down , down , goodness knows where to . At that he woke up with a horrible start , and found that part of his dream was true . A crack had opened at the back of the cave , and was already a wide passage . He was just in time to see the last of the ponies ' tails disappearing into it . Of course he gave a very loud yell , as loud a yell as a hobbit can give , which is surprising for their size . Out jumped the goblins , big goblins , great ugly - looking goblins , lots of goblins , before you could say rocks and blocks . There were six to each dwarf , at least , and two even for Bilbo ; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack , before you could say tinder and flint . But not Gandalf . Bilbo 's yell had done that much good . It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second , and when goblins came to grab him , there was a terrible flash like lightning in the cave , a smell like gunpowder , and several of them fell dead . The crack closed with a snap , and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it ! Where was Gandalf ? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea , and the goblins did not wait to find out . It was deep , deep , dark , such as only goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through . The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions , but the goblins knew their way , as well as you do to the nearest post-office ; and the way went down and down , and it was most horribly stuffy . The goblins were very rough , and pinched unmercifully , and chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices ; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes .

Several hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would not have compared with it . The sparks were burning holes in the goblins , and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see through . Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor , biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad . Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light . Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage . He fell dead , and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness . The sword went back into its sheath . "" Follow me quick ! "" said a voice fierce and quiet ; and before Bilbo understood what had happened he was trotting along again , as fast as he could trot , at the end of the line , down more dark passages with the yells of the goblin-hall growing fainter behind him . A pale light was leading them on . "" Quicker , quicker ! "" said the voice . "" The torches will soon be relit . "" "" Half a minute ! "" said Dori , who was at the back next to Bilbo , and a decent fellow . He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands , and then off they all went at a run , with a clink- clink of chains , and many a stumble , since they had no hands to steady themselves with .

Hobbit_1137_28	literature	"On we go ! "" On they went . Gandalf was quite right : they began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through . That sent them on faster than ever , and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast - for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace , I can tell you , when they have to - they took it in turn to carry him on their backs . Still goblins go faster than dwarves , and these goblins knew the way better ( they had made the paths themselves ) , and were madly angry ; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer . Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet , many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner . The blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following ; and they were getting deadly tired . "" Why , O why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole ! "" said poor Mr. Baggins bumping up and down on Bombur 's back . "" Why , O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt ! "" said poor Bombur , who was fat , and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat and terror . At this point Gandalf fell behind , and Thorin with him . They turned a sharp corner . "" About turn ! "" he shouted . "" Draw your sword , Thorin ! "" There was nothing else to be done ; and the goblins did not like it . They came scurrying round the corner in full cry , and found Goblin-cleaver and Foe-hammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes . The ones in front dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed . The ones behind yelled still more , and leaped back knocking over those that were running after them . "" Biter and Beater ! "" they shrieked ; and soon they were all in confusion , and most of them were hustling back the way they had come . It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that corner . By that time the dwarves had gone on again , a long , long , way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins ' realm . When the goblins discovered that , they put out their torches and they slipped on soft shoes , and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes . These ran forward , as swift as weasels in the dark , and with hardly any more noise than bats . That is why neither Bilbo , nor the dwarves , nor even Gandalf heard them coming ."

"" What did I tell you ? "" said Gandalf laughing . "" Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess . "" He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows , as he said this , and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out . Then he had questions of his own to ask , for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves , Bilbo had not heard it . He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again , and where they had all got to now . The wizard , to tell the truth , never minded explaining his cleverness more than once , so now he had told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains . But their main gate used to come out on a different pass , one more easy to travel by , so that they often caught people benighted near their gates . Evidently people had given up going that way , and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken , quite recently , because it had been found quite safe up to now .

"" "" I am so dreadfully hungry , "" groaned Bilbo , who was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal since the night before the night before last . Just think of that for a hobbit ! His stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly , now that the excitement was over . "" Ca n't help it , "" said Gandalf , "" unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage . "" "" No thank you ! "" said Bilbo . "" Very well then , we must just tighten our belts and trudge on - or we shall be made into supper , and that will be much worse than having none ourselves . "" As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat ; but the blackberries were still only in flower , and of course there were no nuts , nor even hawthorn - berries . He nibbled a bit of sorrel , and he drank from a small mountain -stream that crossed the path , and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its bank , but it was not much good . They still went on and on . The rough path disappeared . The bushes , and the long grasses , between the boulders , the patches of rabbit-cropped turf , the thyme and the sage and the marjoram , and the yellow rockroses all vanished , and they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones , the remains of a landslide . When they began to go down this , rubbish and small pebbles rolled away from their feet ; soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces below them slithering and rolling ; then lumps of rocks were disturbed and bounded off , crashing down with a dust and a noise . Before long the whole slope above them and below them seemed on the move , and they were sliding away , huddled all together , in a fearful confusion of slipping , rattling , cracking slabs and stones . It was the trees at the bottom that saved them . They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below . Some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower branches , some ( like the little hobbit ) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks . Soon the danger was over , the slide had stopped , and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below .

Hobbit_1878_19	literature	Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time ; but in the cold and the wind , with wolves all round below waiting for you , they can be perfectly miserable places . This glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting -place of the wolves . More and more kept coming in . They left guards at the foot of the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were , and then went sniffling about till they had smelt out every tree that had anyone in it . These they guarded too , while all the rest ( hundreds and hundreds it seemed ) went and sat in a great circle in the glade ; and in the middle of the circle was a great grey wolf . He spoke to them in the dreadful language of the Wargs . Gandalf understood it . Bilbo did not , but it sounded terrible to him , and as if all their talk was about cruel and wicked things , as it was . Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together , and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree . I will tell you what Gandalf heard , though Bilbo did not understand it . The Wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds . Goblins do not usually venture very far from their mountains , unless they are driven out and are looking for new homes , or are marching to war ( which I am glad to say has not happened for a long while ) . But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids , especially to get food or slaves to work for them . Then they often got the Wargs to help and shared the plunder with them . Sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses . Now it seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night . The Wargs had come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late . The reason , no doubt , was the death of the Great Goblin , and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard , for whom they were probably still hunting . In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from the South , cutting down trees , and building themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores . There were many of them , and they were brave and well - armed , and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together , or in the bright day . But now they had planned with the goblins ' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains . If their plan had been carried out , there would have been none left there next day ; all would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to their caves . This was dreadful talk to listen to , not only because of the brave woodmen and their wives and children , but also because of the danger which now threatened Gandalf and his friends .

Hobbit_1930_30	literature	But the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds ; they were proud and strong and noble-hearted . They did not love goblins , or fear them . When they took any notice of them at all ( which was seldom , for they did not eat such creatures ) , they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves , and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing . The goblins hated the eagles and feared them , but could not reach their lofty seats , or drive them from the mountains . Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot ; so he summoned many other eagles to him , and they flew away from the mountains , and slowly circling ever round and round they came down , down , down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting -place of the goblins . A very good thing too ! Dreadful things had been going on down there . The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places . It was high summer , and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time . Yellowing bracken , fallen branches , deep-piled pine-needles , and here and there dead trees , were soon in flames . All round the clearing of the Wargs fire was leaping . But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees . Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks , and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language , with their tongues hanging out , and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames . Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling . They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on ; but they soon learnt what had really happened . Some of them actually sat down and laughed . Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields . Goblins are not afraid of fire , and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing . Some got all the wolves together in a pack . Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks . Others rushed round and stamped and beat , and beat and stamped , until nearly all the flames were put out - but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were . That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken . Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves , a ring which they kept from spreading outwards ; but it closed slowly in , till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees .

Hobbit_1973_2	literature	"That would have been the end of him , though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt . But he never leaped . Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above , seized him in his talons , and was gone . There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins . Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles , to whom Gandalf had now spoken . Back swept the great birds that were with him , and down they came like huge black shadows . The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth ; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage , and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain . Over them swooped the eagles ; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away ; their talons tore at goblin faces . Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves , who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go . Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again ! He just managed to catch hold of Dori 's legs , as Dori was borne off last of all ; and they went together above the tumult and the burning , Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking . Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods . A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battle - ground . The flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches . They went up in crackling fire . There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke . Bilbo had escaped only just in time ! Soon the light of the burning was faint below , a red twinkle on the black floor ; and they were high up in the sky , rising all the time in strong sweeping circles . Bilbo never forgot that flight , clinging onto Dori 's ankles . He moaned "" my arms , my arms ! "" ; but Dori groaned "" my poor legs , my poor legs ! "" At the best of times heights made Bilbo giddy . He used to turn queer if he looked over the edge of quite a little cliff ; and he had never liked ladders , let alone trees ( never having had to escape from wolves before ) . So you can imagine how his head swam now , when he looked down between his dangling toes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him , touched here and there with the light of the moon on a hill - side rock or a stream in the plains ."

They still had a long way to walk before them . Up slope and down dale they plodded . It grew very hot . Sometimes they rested under the trees , and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns , if any had been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground . It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of flowers had begun to spring up , all the same kinds growing together as if they had been planted . Especially there was clover , waving patches of cockscomb clover , and purple clover , and wide stretches of short white sweet honey -smelling clover .

Hobbit_2321_2	literature	Inside the hall it was now quite dark . Beorn clapped his hands , and in trotted four beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs . Beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk . They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths , which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth . The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished , and carry things with their fore-feet . Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the fire . Then baa-baa - baa ! was heard , and in came some snow - white sheep led by a large coal - black ram . One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals ; others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons , which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle tables . These were very low , low enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably . Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin , while at the far end he put Beorn 's big black chair of the same sort ( in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table ) . These were all the chairs he had in his hall , and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him . What did the rest sit on ? They were not forgotten . The other ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs , smoothed and polished , and low enough even for Bilbo ; so soon they were all seated at Beorn 's table , and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year . There they had a supper , or a dinner , such as they had not had since they left the Last Homely House in the West and said good -bye to Elrond . The light of the torches and the fire flickered about them , and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles . All the time they ate , Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains , and especially of the dark and dangerous wood , that lay outstretched far to North and South a day 's ride before them , barring their way to the East , the terrible forest of Mirkwood . The dwarves listened and shook their beards , for they knew that they must soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to pass before they came to the dragon 's stronghold . When dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own , but Beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them . They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith- craft , and Beorn did not appear to care for such things : there were no things of gold or silver in his hall , and few save the knives were made of metal at all .

Hobbit_2408_31	literature	" So here you all are still !  he said . He picked up the hobbit and laughed : "" Not eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see "" ; and he poked Mr. Baggins ' waistcoat most disrespectfully . "" Little bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey , "" he chuckled . "" Come and have some more ! "" So they all went to breakfast with him . Beorn was most jolly for a change ; indeed he seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny stories ; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to them , for he told them himself . He had been over the river and right back up into the mountains - from which you can guess that he could travel quickly , in bear 's shape at any rate . From the burnt wolf - glade he had soon found out that part of their story was true ; but he had found more than that : he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods . From these he had got news : the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves , and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin , and also because of the burning of the chief wolf 's nose and the death from the wizard 's fire of many of his chief servants . So much they told him when he forced them , but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot , and that a great raid of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves , or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that lived there , and who they thought must be sheltering them . "" It was a good story , that of yours , "" said Beorn , "" but I like it still better now I am sure it is true . You must forgive my not taking your word . If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood , you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better . As it is , I can only say that I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe , and to offer you any help that I can . I shall think more kindly of dwarves after this . Killed the Great Goblin , killed the Great Goblin ! "" he chuckled fiercely to himself . "" What did you do with the goblin and the Warg ? "" asked Bilbo suddenly . "" Come and see ! "" said Beorn , and they followed round the house . A goblin's head was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond . Beorn was a fierce enemy . But now he was their friend , and Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole story and the reason of their journey , so that they could get the most help he could offer . This is what he promised to do for them . He would provide ponies for each of them , and a horse for Gandalf , for their journey to the forest , and he would lade them with food to last them for weeks with care , and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry - nuts , flour , sealed jars of dried fruits , and red earthenware pots of honey , and twice - baked cakes that would keep good a long time , and on a little of which they could march far ."

Flies and Spiders They walked in single file . The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together , too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves . The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks . Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind , and the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened . As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer . Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above , and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath , stabbed down thin and bright before them .

There were none stretched across the path , but whether because some magic kept it clear , or for what other reason they could not guess . It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the goblins , and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending . But they had to go on and on , long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky , and longed for the feel of wind on their faces . There was no movement of air down under the forest-roof , and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy . Even the dwarves felt it , who were used to tunnelling , and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun ; but the hobbit , who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in , felt he was being slowly suffocated .

Hobbit_2744_21	literature	" Let your legs take their share , we have carried you far enough .  All the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself on the ground . "" Go on , if you must , "" he said . "" I 'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food , if I ca n't get it any other way . I hope I never wake up again . "" At that very moment Balin , who was a little way ahead , called out : "" What was that ? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest . "" They all looked , and a longish way off , it seemed , they saw a red twinkle in the dark ; then another and another sprang out beside it . Even Bombur got up , and they hurried along then , not caring if it was trolls or goblins . The light was in front of them and to the left of the path , and when at last they had drawn level with it , it seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the trees , but a good way off their track . "" It looks as if my dreams were coming true , "" gasped Bombur puffing up behind . He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights . But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn . "" A feast would be no good , if we never got back alive from it , "" said Thorin . "" But without a feast we sha n't remain alive much longer anyway , "" said Bombur , and Bilbo heartily agreed with him . They argued about it backwards and forwards for a long while , until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies , to creep near the lights and find out more about them . But then they could not agree on who was to be sent : no one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and never finding his friends again . In the end , in spite of warnings , hunger decided them , because Bombur kept on describing all the good things that were being eaten , according to his dream , in the woodland feast ; so they all left the path and plunged into the forest together . After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled . There were many people there , elvish- looking folk , all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great circle . There was a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round about ; but most splendid sight of all : they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily . The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that , without waiting to consult one another , every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into the ring with the one idea of begging for some food . No sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic ."

Hobbit_2779_4	literature	"They wo n't be frightened of him - ( ' What about me of them ? ' thought Bilbo ) - and any way I hope they wo n't do anything nasty to him . "" When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind . Before he had time to slip on his ring , he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire and torches . It was no good . Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell . If it had been difficult collecting themselves before , it was far worse this time . And they simply could not find the hobbit . Every time they counted themselves it only made thirteen . They shouted and called : "" Bilbo Baggins ! Hobbit ! You dratted hobbit ! Hi ! hobbit , confusticate you , where are you ? "" and other things of that sort , but there was no answer . They were just giving up hope , when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck . In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log , and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep . It took a deal of shaking to wake him , and when he was awake he was not pleased at all . "" I was having such a lovely dream , "" he grumbled , "" all about having a most gorgeous dinner . "" "" Good heavens ! he has gone like Bombur , "" they said . "" Do n't tell us about dreams . Dream- dinners are n't any good , and we ca n't share them .

And hark to the singing and the harps ! "" After lying and listening for a while , they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try once more to get help . Up they got again ; and this time the result was disastrous . The feast that they now saw was greater and more magnificent than before ; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair , very much as Bombur had described the figure in his dream . The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires , and some were harping and many were singing . Their gloaming hair was twined with flowers ; green and white gems glinted on their collars and their belts ; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth . Loud and clear and fair were those songs , and out stepped Thorin into their midst . Dead silence fell in the middle of a word . Out went all light . The fires leaped up in black smokes . Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves , and the wood was filled again with their clamour and their cries . Bilbo found himself running round and round ( as he thought ) and calling and calling : "" Dori , Nori , Ori , Oin , Gloin , Fili , Kili , Bombur , Bifur , Bofur , Dwalin , Balin , Thorin Oakenshield , "" while people he could not see or feel were doing the same all round him ( with an occasional "" Bilbo ! "" thrown in ) . But the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter , and though after a while it seemed to him they changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance , all noise at last died right away , and he was left alone in complete silence and darkness . That was one of his most miserable moments . But he soon made up his mind that it was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light , and quite useless to go blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any breakfast to revive him . So he sat himself down with his back to a tree , and not for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit -hole with its beautiful pantries ."

Hobbit_2847_2	literature	"He had picked his way stealthily for some distance , when he noticed a place of dense black shadow ahead of him black even for that forest , like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away . As he drew nearer , he saw that it was made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another . Suddenly he saw , too , that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him , and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him . Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time , and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were speaking one to another . Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing , but he could make out many of the words that they said . They were talking about the dwarves ! "" It was a sharp struggle , but worth it , "" said one . "" What nasty thick skins they have to be sure , but I 'll wager there is good juice inside . "" "" Aye , they 'll make fine eating , when they 've hung a bit , "" said another . "" Do n't hang 'em too long , "" said a third . "" They 're not as fat as they might be . Been feeding none too well of late , I should guess . "" "" Kill 'em , I say , "" hissed a fourth ; "" kill 'em now and hang 'em dead for a while . "" "" They 're dead now , I 'll warrant , "" said the first . "" That they are not . I saw one a-struggling just now . Just coming round again , I should say , after a bee-autiful sleep . I 'll show you . "" With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope , till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a row from a high branch . Bilbo was horrified , now that he noticed them for the first time dangling in the shadows , to see a dwarvish foot sticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles , or here and there the tip of a nose , or a bit of beard or of a hood . To the fattest of these bundles the spider went - "" It is poor old Bombur , I 'll bet , "" thought Bilbo - and nipped hard at the nose that stuck out . There was a muffled yelp inside , and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard . There was life in Bombur still ."

Hobbit_2887_1	literature	When about fifty had gone off to the place where he had stood before , he threw some more stones at these , and at others that had stopped behind ; then dancing among the trees he began to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him , and also to let the dwarves hear his voice . This is what he sang : [ vs ] Not very good perhaps , but then you must remember that he had to make it up himself , on the spur of a very awkward moment . It did what he wanted any way . As he sang he threw some more stones and stamped . Practically all the spiders in the place came after him : some dropped to the ground , others raced along the branches , swung from tree to tree , or cast new ropes across the dark spaces . They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected . They were frightfully angry . Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop , and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody . Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place , but several of the spiders had run now to different points in the glade where they lived , and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree-stems .

Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his courage and began a new song : [ vs ] With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had been closed with a web - but luckily not a proper web , only great strands of double - thick spider- rope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to trunk .

The spiders saw the sword , though I do n't suppose they knew what it was , and at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches , hairy legs waving , nippers and spinners snapping , eyes popping , full of froth and rage . They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as he dared . Then quieter than a mouse he stole back .

Somehow or other Fili was got on to the branch , and then he did his best to help the hobbit , although he was feeling very sick and ill from spider-poison , and from hanging most of the night and the next day wound round and round with only his nose to breathe through . It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his eyes and eyebrows , and as for his beard , he had to cut most of it off . Well , between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free . None of them were better off than Fili , and some of them were worse . Some had hardly been able to breathe at all ( long noses are sometimes useful you see ) , and some had been more poisoned . In this way they rescued Kili , Bifur , Bofur , Don and Nori . Poor old Bombur was so exhausted - he was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked - that he just rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground , fortunately on to leaves , and lay there . But there were still five dwarves hanging at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back , more full of rage than ever . Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back those that crawled up . He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten to put it on again , so now they all began to splutter and hiss : "" Now we see you , you nasty little creature ! We will eat you and leave your bones and skin hanging on a tree ."

Hobbit_3014_17	literature	"And then he fell asleep , and there was complete silence for a long time . All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye , and looked round at them . "" Where is Thorin ? "" he asked . It was a terrible shock . Of course there were only thirteen of them , twelve dwarves and the hobbit . Where indeed was Thorin ? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him , magic or dark monsters ; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest . There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams , as evening wore to black night ; and there we must leave them for the present , too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching . Thorin had been caught much faster than they had . You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep , as he stepped into a circle of light ? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward , and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted . All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night , their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them , and all the sounds of the battle next day , had passed over him unheard . Then the Wood-elves had come to him , and bound him , and carried him away . The feasting people were Wood-elves , of course . These are not wicked folk . If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers . Though their magic was strong , even in those days they were wary . They differed from the High Elves of the West , and were more dangerous and less wise . For most of them ( together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains ) were descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West . There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages , and grew fairer and wiser and more learned , and invented their magic and their cunning craft , in the making of beautiful and marvellous things , before some came back into the Wide World . In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon but loved best the stars ; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost . They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods , from which they could escape at times to hunt , or to ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight ; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk . Still elves they were and remain , and that is Good People ."

Hobbit_3079_16	literature	"Each dwarf was blindfold , but that did not make much difference , for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see where they were going , and neither he nor the others knew where they had started from anyway . Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches , for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could , sick and weary as they were . The king had ordered them to make haste . Suddenly the torches stopped , and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the bridge . This was the bridge that led across the river to the king 's doors . The water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath ; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees . There the great beeches came right down to the bank , till their feet were in the stream . Across this bridge the elves thrust their prisoners , but Bilbo hesitated in the rear . He did not at all like the look of the cavern- mouth and he only made up his mind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the fast elves , before the great gates of the king closed behind them with a clang . Inside the passages were lit with red torch - light , and the elf-guards sang as they marched along the twisting , crossing , and echoing paths . These were not like those of the goblin-cities : they were smaller , less deep underground , and filled with a cleaner air . In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood . On his head was a crown of berries and red leaves , for the autumn was come again . In the spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers . In his hand he held a carven staff of oak . The prisoners were brought before him ; and though he looked grimly at them , he told his men to unbind them , for they were ragged and weary . "" Besides they need no ropes in here , "" said he . "" There is no escape from my magic doors for those who are once brought inside . "" Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings , and where they were going to , and where they were coming from ; but he got little more news out of them than out of Thorin . They were surly and angry and did not even pretend to be polite . "" What have we done , O king ? "" said Balin , who was the eldest left . "" Is it a crime to be lost in the forest , to be hungry and thirsty , to be trapped by spiders ? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your pets , if killing them makes you angry ?

Hobbit_3186_8	literature	"Then off he went from door to door , until his following had grown to twelve - none of them any too nimble , what with the dark , and what with their long imprisonment . Bilbo 's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another , or grunted or whispered in the dark . "" Drat this dwarvish racket ! "" he said to himself . But all went well , and they met no guards . As a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night , and in the halls above . Nearly all the king 's folks were merrymaking . At last after much blundering they came to Thorin 's dungeon , far down in a deep place and fortunately not far from the cellars . "" Upon my word ! "" said Thorin , when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends , "" Gandalf spoke true , as usual . A pretty fine burglar you make , it seems , when the time comes . I am sure we are all for ever at your service , whatever happens after this . But what comes next ? "" Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea , as far as he could ; but he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it . His fears were quite justified , for they did not like it a bit , and started grumbling loudly in spite of their danger . "" We shall be bruised and battered to pieces , and drowned too , for certain ! "" they muttered . "" We thought you had got some sensible notion , when you managed to get hold of the keys . This is a mad idea ! "" "" Very well ! "" said Bilbo very downcast , and also rather annoyed . "" Come along back to your nice cells , and I will lock you all in again , and you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan - but I do n't suppose I shall ever get hold of the keys again , even if I feel inclined to try . "" "" That was too much for them , and they calmed down . In the end , of course , they had to do just what Bilbo suggested , because it was obviously impossible for them to try and find their way into the upper halls , or to fight their way out of gates that closed by magic ; and it was no good grumbling in the passages until they were caught again . So following the hobbit , down into the lowest cellars they crept . They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler could be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces .

"" Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred . The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors . There was little time to lose . Before long , as Bilbo knew , some elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the stream . These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off . Some of them were wine - barrels , and these were not much use , as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise , nor could they easily be secured again . But among them were several others which had been used for bringing other stuffs , butter , apples , and all sorts of things , to the king 's palace . They soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each . In fact some were too roomy , and as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get inside , though Bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short time .

Hobbit_3272_20	literature	"In despair and not knowing what else to do , poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it . Down into the water he fell , splash ! into the cold dark water with the barrel on top of him . He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat , but for all his efforts he could not scramble on top . Every time he tried , the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again . It was really empty , and floated light as a cork . Though his ears were full of water , he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above . Then suddenly the trapdoors fell to with a boom and their voices faded away . He was in the dark tunnel , floating in icy water , all alone - for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels . Very soon a grey patch came up in the darkness ahead . He heard the creak of the water - gate being hauled up , and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream . He had as much as he could do to prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits ; but at last the jostling crowd began to break up and swing off , one by one , under the stone arch and away . Then he saw that it would have been no good even if he had managed to get astride his barrel , for there was no room to spare , not even for a hobbit , between its top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was . Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank . Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs . Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water , and he guessed that these had dwarves inside . "" I do hope I put the lids on tight enough ! "" he thought , but before long he was worrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves . He managed to keep his head above the water , but he was shivering with the cold , and he wondered if he would die of it before the luck turned , and how much longer he would be able to hang on , and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to swim to the bank . The luck turned all right before long : the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some hidden root . Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his barrel while it was held steady against another . Up he crawled like a drowned rat , and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could . The breeze was cold but better than the water , and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once more .

The breeze was cold but better than the water , and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once more . Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream , and out into the main current Then he found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared ; but he managed it somehow , though it was miserably uncomfortable . Luckily he was very light , and the barrel was a good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water . All the same it was like trying to ride , without bridle or stirrups , a round - bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on the grass . In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner . He could see the paler sky between them . The dark river opened suddenly wide , and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the king 's great doors . There was a dim sheet of water no longer overshadowed , and on its sliding surface there were dancing and broken reflections of clouds and of stars . Then the hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank , in which it had eaten out a wide bay . This had a shingly shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock . On the shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground , though a few went on to bump against the stony pier . There were people on the look -out on the banks . They quickly poled and pushed all the barrels together into the shallows , and when they had counted them they roped them together and left them till the morning . Poor dwarves ! Bilbo was not so badly off now . He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore , and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water 's edge . He no longer thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance , he had been obliged to do it for so long , and he knew only too well what it was to be really hungry , not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well - filled larder . Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees , and that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy . There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night , for now we are drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure , so we must hurry on . Of course helped by his magic ring he got on very well at first , but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat ; and also he began to snivel , and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes . Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside ; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him .

Hobbit_3378_7	literature	"As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of the town , and voices hailed the raft-steerers . Then ropes were cast and oars were pulled , and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the Forest River and towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of Lake-town . There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge . Soon men would come up from the South and take some of the casks away , and others they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the Wood-elves ' home . In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town . They would have been surprised , if they could have seen what happened down by the shore , after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen . First of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened . Groans came from inside , and out crept a most unhappy dwarf . Wet straw was in his draggled beard ; he was so sore and stiff , so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore . He had a famished and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week . It was Thorin , but you could only have told it by his golden chain , and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky -blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel . It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit . "" Well , are you alive or are you dead ? "" asked Bilbo quite crossly . Perhaps he had forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves , and also the use of his arms and legs , not to speak of a greater allowance of air . "" Are you still in prison , or are you free ? If you want food , and if you want to go on with this silly adventure - it 's yours after all and not mine - you had better slap your arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance ! "" Thorin of course saw the sense of this , so after a few more groans he got up and helped the hobbit as well as he could . In the darkness floundering in the cold water they had a difficult and very nasty job finding which were the right barrels . Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six dwarves that could answer . They were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay muttering and moaning ; they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it . Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy , and it was no good asking them to help . Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier , but they lay down and would do nothing . Fili and Kili , however , who were young ( for dwarves ) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks , came out more or less smiling , with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that soon wore off ."

Hobbit_3630_6	literature	If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest . As the sun turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof , as if the light caught the last pale leaves . Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes . He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth . At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him . There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush , nearly coal black , its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots . Crack ! It had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone . Crack ! Crack ! Suddenly Bilbo understood . Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the dwarves , shouting and paying . Those that were nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him , wondering what on earth was the matter ; the others shouted to be hauled up the ropes ( except Bombur , of course : he was asleep ) . Quickly Bilbo explained . They all fell silent : the hobbit standing by the grey stone , and the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently . The sun sank lower and lower , and their hopes fell . It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and disappeared . The dwarves groaned , but still Bilbo stood almost without moving .

This was no goblin entrance , or rough wood-elves ' cave . It was a passage made by dwarves , at the height of their wealth and skill : straight as a ruler , smooth -floored and smooth-sided , going with a gentle never-varying slope direct to some distant end in the blackness below .

There he lay , a vast red-golden dragon , fast asleep ; thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils , and wisps of smoke , but his fires were low in slumber . Beneath him , under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail , and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors , lay countless piles of precious things , gold wrought and unwrought , gems and jewels , and silver red-stained in the ruddy light . Smaug lay , with wings folded like an immeasurable bat , turned partly on one side , so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed . Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail , helms and axes , swords and spears hanging ; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled with a wealth that could not be guessed .

He thrust his head in vain at the little hole , and then coiling his length together , roaring like thunder underground , he sped from his deep lair through its great door , out into the huge passages of the mountain - palace and up towards the Front Gate . To hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and trampled him was his one thought . He issued from the Gate , the waters rose in fierce whistling steam , and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the mountain - top in a spout of green and scarlet flame . The dwarves heard the awful rumour of his flight , and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace cringing under boulders , hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the hunting dragon . There they would have all been killed , if it had not been for Bilbo once again . "" Quick ! Quick ! "" he gasped . "" The door ! The tunnel ! It 's no good here . "" Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when Bifur gave a cry : "" My cousins ! Bombur and Bofur - we have forgotten them , they are down in the valley ! "" "" They will be slain , and all our ponies too , and all out stores lost , "" moaned the others . "" We can do nothing . "" "" Nonsense ! "" said Thorin , recovering his dignity .

Not at Home In the meanwhile , the dwarves sat in darkness , and utter silence fell about them . Little they ate and little they spoke . They could not count the passing of time ; and they scarcely dared to move , for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel . If they dozed , they woke still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken . At last after days and days of waiting , as it seemed , when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air , they could bear it no longer . They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon 's return . In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his , but they could not sit there for ever . Thorin spoke : "" Let us try the door ! "" he said . "" I must feel the wind on my face soon or die . I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here !

After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning , in with a small pine-torch alight in his hand , and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm . Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch ; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet . As Thorin carefully explained , Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator . If he liked to risk a light , that was his affair . They would wait in the tunnel for his report . So they sat near the door and watched . They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft . Every now and again , while he was still near enough , they caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing . The light grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall ; then it began to rise dancing into the air . Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure . Soon he stood upon the top , and still went on . Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment ; but they did not know the reason . It was the Arkenstone , the Heart of the Mountain . So Bilbo guessed from Thorin 's description ; but indeed there could not be two such gems , even in so marvellous a hoard , even in all the world . Ever as he climbed , the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light . Now as he came near , it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of man colours at the surface , reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch . At last he looked down upon it and he caught his breath . The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner light , and yet , cut and fashioned by the dwarves , who had dug it from the heart of the mountain long ago , it took all light that fell upon it and - changes it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow . Suddenly Bilbo 's arm went towards it drawn by it enchantment . His small hand would not close about it for it was a large and heavy gem ; but he lifted it , shut his eyes , and put it in his deepest pocket . "" Now I am a burglar indeed ! "" thought he .

' "" Now what on earth or under it has happened ? "" said Thorin . "" Certainly not the dragon , or he would not go on squeaking .

He did not , of course , expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon 's weak spot ; and that was just as well , for no one ever did . But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long brooded , nor with dwarvish hearts . Long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury , and the lust of it was heavy on him .

Hobbit_4971_6	literature	" There is yet time for council . Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to us !  So began a battle that none had expected ; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies , and it was very terrible . Upon one side were the Goblins and the wild Wolves , and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves . This is how it fell out . Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury . Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities , colonies and strongholds ; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North . Tidings they had gathered in secret ways ; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming . Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley , going ever by tunnel or under dark , until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North , where was their capital , a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon the South . Then they learnt of the death of Smaug , and joy was in their hearts : and they hastened night after night through the mountains , and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain . Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind . How much Gandalf knew cannot be said , but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault . This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard ; and with Dain , for the dwarf - lord now joined them : the Goblins were the foes of all , and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten . Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain ; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east . Yet this would be perilous , if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself , and so attack them also from behind and above ; but there was no time for make any other plan , or to summon any help . Soon the thunder passed , rolling away to the South - East ; but the bat-cloud came , flying lower , over the shoulder of the Mountain , and whirled above them shutting out the light and filling them with dread . "" To the Mountain ! "" called Bard . "" To the Mountain ! Let us take our places while there is yet time ! "" On the Southern spur , in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet , the Elves were set ; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves . But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North .

These were the swiftest wolf-riders , and already their cries and howls rent the air afar . A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance , and many there fell before the rest drew back and fled to either side . As Gandalf had hoped , the goblin army had gathered behind the resisted vanguard , and poured now in rage into the valley , driving wildly up between the arms of the Mountain , seeking for the foe . Their banners were countless , black and red , and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder . It was a terrible battle . The most dreadful of all Bilbo 's experiences , and the one which at the time he hated most - which is to say it was the one he was most proud of , and most fond of recalling long afterwards , although he was quite unimportant in it . Actually I must say he put on his ring early in the business , and vanished from sight , if not from all danger . A magic ring of that sort is not a complete protection in a goblin charge , nor does it stop flying arrows and wild spears ; but it does help in getting out of the way , and it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman ."

Hobbit_5176_4	literature	"I mean , I should have liked to see them again , "" said Bilbo sleepily ; "" perhaps I shall see them on the way home . I suppose I shall be going home soon ? "" "" As soon as you like , "" said the wizard . Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out . They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain , and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast . "" There let it lie till the Mountain falls ! "" he said . "" May it bring good fortune to all his folk that dwell here after ! "" Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist , the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in captivity . It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached , and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise . There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode , and he became King under the Mountain , and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls . Of the twelve companions of Thorin , ten remained . Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body , for he was their mother 's elder brother . The others remained with Dain ; for Dain dealt his treasure well . There was , of course , no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been planned , to Balin and Dwalin , and Dori and Nori and Ori , and Oin and Gloin , and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur - or to Bilbo . Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold , wrought and unwrought , was given up to Bard ; for Dain said : "" We will honour the agreement of the dead , and he has now the Arkenstone in his keeping . "" Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great , greater than that of many mortal kings . From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town ; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely . To the Elvenking he gave the emeralds of Girion , such jewels as he most loved , which Dain had restored to him . To Bilbo he said : "" This treasure is as much yours as it is mine ; though old agreements cannot stand , since so many have a claim in its winning and defence . Yet even though you were willing to lay aside all your claim , I should wish that the words of Thorin , of which he repented , should not prove true : that we should give you little .

"" said the king gravely . "" And I name you elf-friend and blessed . May your shadow never grow less ( or stealing would be too easy ) ! Farewell ! "" Then the elves turned towards the Forest , and Bilbo started on his long road home . He had many hardships and adventures before he got back . The Wild was still the Wild , and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins ; but he was well guided and well guarded - the wizard was with him , and Beorn for much of the way - and he was never in great danger again . Anyway by mid-winter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back , along both edges of the Forest , to the doors of Beorn 's house ; and there for a while they both stayed . Yule -tide was warm and merry there ; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn 's bidding . The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified , and hidden in the deepest holes they could find ; and the Wargs had vanished from the woods , so that men went abroad without fear . Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood ; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear 's shape , and some were grim men and bad , but most were in heart like Beorn , if less in size and strength . In their day the last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild . It was spring , and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun , before Bilbo and Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn , and though he longed for home . Bilbo left with regret , for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less marvellous than in high summer . At last they came up the long road , and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them before . But they came to that high point at morning , and looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the out-stretched lands . There behind lay Mirkwood , blue in the distance , and darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring . There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight . On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale . "" So comes snow after fire , and even dragons have their ending ! "" said Bilbo , and he turned his back on his adventure . The Tookish part was getting very tired , and the Baggins was daily getting stronger ."

There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden ; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles , superior couples holding each other tortuously , fashionably , and keeping in the corners — and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps . By midnight the hilarity had increased . A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian , and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz , and between the numbers people were doing “ stunts ” all over the garden , while happy , vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky . A pair of stage twins , who turned out to be the girls in yellow , did a baby act in costume , and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls . The moon had risen higher , and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales , trembling a little to the stiff , tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn . I was still with Jordan Baker .

But young men did n’t — at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t — drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound . “ Anyhow , he gives large parties , ” said Jordan , changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete . “ And I like large parties .

A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby ’s house , making the night fine as before , and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden . A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors , endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host , who stood on the porch , his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell . PARA_BREAK Reading over what I have written so far , I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me . On the contrary , they were merely casual events in a crowded summer , and , until much later , they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs . Most of the time I worked . In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust . I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names , and lunched with them in dark , crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee . I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department , but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction , so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away .

Gatsby_999_46	literature	Most of the time I worked . In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust . I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names , and lunched with them in dark , crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee . I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department , but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction , so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away . I took dinner usually at the Yale Club — for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day — and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour . There were generally a few rioters around , but they never came into the library , so it was a good place to work . After that , if the night was mellow , I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel , and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station . I began to like New York , the racy , adventurous feel of it at night , and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye . I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives , and no one would ever know or disapprove . Sometimes , in my mind , I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets , and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness . At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes , and felt it in others — poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner — young clerks in the dusk , wasting the most poignant moments of night and life . Again at eight o’clock , when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs , bound for the theatre district , I felt a sinking in my heart .

Again at eight o’clock , when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs , bound for the theatre district , I felt a sinking in my heart . Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited , and voices sang , and there was laughter from unheard jokes , and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside . Imagining that I , too , was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement , I wished them well . For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker , and then in midsummer I found her again . At first I was flattered to go places with her , because she was a golf champion , and everyone knew her name . Then it was something more . I was n’t actually in love , but I felt a sort of tender curiosity . The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something — most affectations conceal something eventually , even though they do n’t in the beginning — and one day I found what it was . When we were on a house - party together up in Warwick , she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down , and then lied about it — and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy ’s .

That ’s why I like you . ” Her grey , sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead , but she had deliberately shifted our relations , and for a moment I thought I loved her . But I am slow- thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires , and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home . I ’d been writing letters once a week and signing them : “ Love , Nick , ” and all I could think of was how , when that certain girl played tennis , a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip . Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free . Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues , and this is mine : I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known .

Gatsby_1063_14	literature	The Dancies came , too , and S. B. Whitebait , who was well over sixty , and Maurice A. Flink , and the Hammerheads , and Beluga the tobacco importer , and Beluga ’s girls . From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid , who controlled Films Par Excellence , and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz ( the son ) and Arthur McCarty , all connected with the movies in one way or another . And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon , brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife . Da Fontano the promoter came there , and Ed Legros and James B. ( “ Rot - Gut ” ) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly — they came to gamble , and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day . A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “ the boarder ” — I doubt if he had any other home . Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull . Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns , divorced now , and Henry L. Palmetto , who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square . Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls . They were never quite the same ones in physical person , but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before . I have forgotten their names — Jaqueline , I think , or else Consuela , or Gloria or Judy or June , and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins , if pressed , they would confess themselves to be . In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer , who had his nose shot off in the war , and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag , his fiancée , and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett , once head of the American Legion , and Miss Claudia Hip , with a man reputed to be her chauffeur , and a prince of something , whom we called Duke , and whose name , if I ever knew it , I have forgotten .

Gatsby_1366_38	literature	I saw them one spring in Cannes , and later in Deauville , and then they came back to Chicago to settle down . Daisy was popular in Chicago , as you know . They moved with a fast crowd , all of them young and rich and wild , but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation . Perhaps because she does n’t drink . It ’s a great advantage not to drink among hard - drinking people . You can hold your tongue and , moreover , you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they do n’t see or care . Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all — and yet there ’s something in that voice of hers … Well , about six weeks ago , she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years . It was when I asked you — do you remember ? — if you knew Gatsby in West Egg . After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up , and said : “ What Gatsby ? ” and when I described him — I was half asleep — she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know . It was n’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car .

We both jumped up , and , a little harrowed myself , I went out into the yard . Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive . It stopped . Daisy ’s face , tipped sideways beneath a three - cornered lavender hat , looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile . “ Is this absolutely where you live , my dearest one ? ” The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain .	“ Is this absolutely where you live , my dearest one ? ”	41:48	671:678			dearest		me	ones OF=Daisy	ones	dearness	positive	y		
Gatsby_1631_4	literature	It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door , and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees . And inside , as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons , I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table , under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through . As Gatsby closed the door of “ the Merton College Library ” I could have sworn I heard the owl - eyed man break into ghostly laughter . We went upstairs , through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers , through dressing -rooms and poolrooms , and bathrooms with sunken baths — intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor . It was Mr. Klipspringer , the “ boarder . ” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning . Finally we came to Gatsby ’s own apartment , a bedroom and a bath , and an Adam ’s study , where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall . He had n’t once ceased looking at Daisy , and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well - loved eyes . Sometimes too , he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way , as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real . Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs . His bedroom was the simplest room of all — except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold . Daisy took the brush with delight , and smoothed her hair , whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh .

I began to walk about the room , examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness . A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me , hung on the wall over his desk . “ Who ’s this ? ” “ That ? That ’s Mr. Dan Cody , old sport . ” The name sounded faintly familiar . “ He ’s dead now . He used to be my best friend years ago . ” There was a small picture of Gatsby , also in yachting costume , on the bureau — Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly — taken apparently when he was about eighteen .

Gatsby_1720_6	literature	The rich get richer and the poor get— children . In the meantime , In between time — ” As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby ’s face , as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness . Almost five years ! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams — not through her own fault , but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion . It had gone beyond her , beyond everything . He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion , adding to it all the time , decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way . No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart . As I watched him he adjusted himself a little , visibly . His hand took hold of hers , and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion . I think that voice held him most , with its fluctuating , feverish warmth , because it could n’t be over-dreamed — that voice was a deathless song . They had forgotten me , but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand ; Gatsby did n’t know me now at all .

Gatsby_1735_33	literature	About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby ’s door and asked him if he had anything to say . “ Anything to say about what ? ” inquired Gatsby politely . “ Why — any statement to give out . ” It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby ’s name around his office in a connection which he either would n’t reveal or did n’t fully understand . This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “ to see . ” It was a random shot , and yet the reporter ’s instinct was right . Gatsby ’s notoriety , spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past , had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news . Contemporary legends such as the “ underground pipeline to Canada ” attached themselves to him , and there was one persistent story that he did n’t live in a house at all , but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore . Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota , is n’t easy to say . James Gatz — that was really , or at least legally , his name . He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career — when he saw Dan Cody ’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior . It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants , but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat , pulled out to the Tuolomee , and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour .

I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time , even then . His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all . The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg , Long Island , sprang from his Platonic conception of himself . He was a son of God —a phrase which , if it means anything , means just that — and he must be about His Father ’s business , the service of a vast , vulgar , and meretricious beauty . So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen - year - old boy would be likely to invent , and to this conception he was faithful to the end . For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon -fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed . His brown , hardening body lived naturally through the half -fierce , half - lazy work of the bracing days . He knew women early , and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them , of young virgins because they were ignorant , of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self -absorption he took for granted . But his heart was in a constant , turbulent riot . The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night . A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor .

Gatsby_2004_9	literature	Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees — he could climb to it , if he climbed alone , and once there he could suck on the pap of life , gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder . His heart beat faster as Daisy ’s white face came up to his own . He knew that when he kissed this girl , and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath , his mind would never romp again like the mind of God . So he waited , listening for a moment longer to the tuning - fork that had been struck upon a star . Then he kissed her . At his lips ’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete . Through all he said , even through his appalling sentimentality , I was reminded of something — an elusive rhythm , a fragment of lost words , that I had heard somewhere a long time ago . For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s , as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air . But they made no sound , and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever . VII It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night — and , as obscurely as it had begun , his career as Trimalchio was over . Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away .

Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming . Something was up . And yet I could n’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene — especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden . The next day was broiling , almost the last , certainly the warmest , of the summer .

He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip , and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay .

Gatsby_3075_21	literature	The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly , tracing , like the leg of transit , a thin red circle in the water . It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson ’s body a little way off in the grass , and the holocaust was complete . IX After two years I remember the rest of that day , and that night and the next day , only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby ’s front door . A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious , but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard , and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool . Someone with a positive manner , perhaps a detective , used the expression “ madman ” as he bent over Wilson ’s body that afternoon , and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning . Most of those reports were a nightmare — grotesque , circumstantial , eager , and untrue . When Michaelis ’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson ’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade — but Catherine , who might have said anything , did n’t say a word . She showed a surprising amount of character about it too — looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers , and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby , that her sister was completely happy with her husband , that her sister had been into no mischief whatever . She convinced herself of it , and cried into her handkerchief , as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure . So Wilson was reduced to a man “ deranged by grief ” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form . And it rested there .

But there was nothing — only the picture of Dan Cody , a token of forgotten violence , staring down from the wall . Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem , which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train . That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it . I was sure he ’d start when he saw the newspapers , just as I was sure there ’d be a wire from Daisy before noon — but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived ; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men . When the butler brought back Wolfshiem ’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance , of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all . Dear Mr. Carraway .

Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening , with a few Chicago friends , already caught up into their own holiday gaieties , to bid them a hasty goodbye . I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This - or - That ’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances , and the matchings of invitations : “ Are you going to the Ordways ’ ? the Herseys ’? the Schultzes ’ ? ” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands . And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago , Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate . When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow , our snow , began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows , and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by , a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air . We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules , unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour , before we melted indistinguishably into it again . That ’s my Middle West — not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns , but the thrilling returning trains of my youth , and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow . I am part of that , a little solemn with the feel of those long winters , a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family ’s name . I see now that this has been a story of the West , after all — Tom and Gatsby , Daisy and Jordan and I , were all Westerners , and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life . Even when the East excited me most , even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored , sprawling , swollen towns beyond the Ohio , with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old — even then it had always for me a quality of distortion .

Gatsby_3429_24	literature	I did n’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train . I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming , dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter , faint and incessant , from his garden , and the cars going up and down his drive . One night I did hear a material car there , and saw its lights stop at his front steps . But I did n’t investigate . Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and did n’t know that the party was over . On the last night , with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer , I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more . On the white steps an obscene word , scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick , stood out clearly in the moonlight , and I erased it , drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone . Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand . Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy , moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound . And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors ’ eyes — a fresh , green breast of the new world . Its vanished trees , the trees that had made way for Gatsby ’s house , had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams ; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent , compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired , face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder . And as I sat there brooding on the old , unknown world , I thought of Gatsby ’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy ’s dock .

Animal_Farm_16_3	literature	At one end of the big barn , on a sort of raised platform , Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw , under a lantern which hung from a beam . He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout , but he was still a majestic -looking pig , with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut . Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions . First came the three dogs , Bluebell , Jessie , and Pincher , and then the pigs , who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform . The hens perched themselves on the window-sills , the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters , the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud . The two cart-horses , Boxer and Clover , came in together , walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw . Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life , who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal . Boxer was an enormous beast , nearly eighteen hands high , and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together . A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance , and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence , but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work . After the horses came Muriel , the white goat , and Benjamin , the donkey . Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm , and the worst tempered . He seldom talked , and when he did , it was usually to make some cynical remark - for instance , he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off , but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies .

He seldom talked , and when he did , it was usually to make some cynical remark - for instance , he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off , but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies . Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed . If asked why , he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at . Nevertheless , without openly admitting it , he was devoted to Boxer ; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard , grazing side by side and never speaking . The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings , which had lost their mother , filed into the barn , cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on . Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg , and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep . At the last moment Mollie , the foolish , pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones 's trap , came mincing daintily in , chewing at a lump of sugar . She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane , hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with . Last of all came the cat , who looked round , as usual , for the warmest place , and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover ; there she purred contentedly throughout Major 's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying . All the animals were now present except Moses , the tame raven , who slept on a perch behind the back door .

Napoleon was a large , rather fierce- looking Berkshire boar , the only Berkshire on the farm , not much of a talker , but with a reputation for getting his own way . Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon , quicker in speech and more inventive , but was not considered to have the same depth of character . All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers . The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer , with very round cheeks , twinkling eyes , nimble movements , and a shrill voice . He was a brilliant talker , and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive .

He was a brilliant talker , and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive . The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white . These three had elaborated old Major 's teachings into a complete system of thought , to which they gave the name of Animalism . Several nights a week , after Mr. Jones was asleep , they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others . At the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy . Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones , whom they referred to as "" Master , "" or made elementary remarks such as "" Mr. Jones feeds us . If he were gone , we should starve to death . "" Others asked such questions as "" Why should we care what happens after we are dead ? "" or "" If this Rebellion is to happen anyway , what difference does it make whether we work for it or not ? "" , and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism . The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie , the white mare .

"" Mollie agreed , but she did not sound very convinced . The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by Moses , the tame raven . Moses , who was Mr. Jones 's especial pet , was a spy and a tale - bearer , but he was also a clever talker . He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain , to which all animals went when they died . It was situated somewhere up in the sky , a little distance beyond the clouds , Moses said . In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week , clover was in season all the year round , and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges . The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work , but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain , and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place . Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses , Boxer and Clover .

Animal_Farm_235_13	literature	Yes , it was theirs - everything that they could see was theirs ! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round , they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement . They rolled in the dew , they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass , they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent . Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland , the hayfield , the orchard , the pool , the spinney . It was as though they had never seen these things before , and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own . Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse . That was theirs too , but they were frightened to go inside . After a moment , however , Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file , walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything . They tiptoed from room to room , afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury , at the beds with their feather mattresses , the looking - glasses , the horsehair sofa , the Brussels carpet , the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing - room mantelpiece . They were just coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing . Going back , the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom . She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones 's dressing - table , and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner .

First came the hoisting of the flag . Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones 's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white . This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday - morning . The flag was green , Snowball explained , to represent the green fields of England , while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown . After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting . Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated . It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions . The other animals understood how to vote , but could never think of any resolutions of their own . Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates .

Animal_Farm_430_38	literature	Rumours of a wonderful farm , where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs , continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms , and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside . Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage , sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover , cows kicked the pail over , hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side . Above all , the tune and even the words of Beasts of England were known everywhere . It had spread with astonishing speed . The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song , though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous . They could not understand , they said , how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish . Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot . And yet the song was irrepressible . The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges , the pigeons cooed it in the elms , it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells . And when the human beings listened to it , they secretly trembled , hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom . Early in October , when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed , a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement . Jones and all his men , with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield , had entered the five- barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm .

Snowball now gave the signal for the charge . He himself dashed straight for Jones . Jones saw him coming , raised his gun and fired . The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball 's back , and a sheep dropped dead . Without halting for an instant , Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones 's legs . Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands . But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer , rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion .

Animal_Farm_536_23	literature	"He was especially successful with the sheep . Of late the sheep had taken to bleating "" Four legs good , two legs bad "" both in and out of season , and they often interrupted the Meeting with this . It was noticed that they were especially liable to break into "" Four legs good , two legs bad "" at crucial moments in Snowball 's speeches . Snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the Farmer and Stockbreeder which he had found in the farmhouse , and was full of plans for innovations and improvements . He talked learnedly about field drains , silage , and basic slag , and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields , at a different spot every day , to save the labour of cartage . Napoleon produced no schemes of his own , but said quietly that Snowball 's would come to nothing , and seemed to be biding his time . But of all their controversies , none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill . In the long pasture , not far from the farm buildings , there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm . After surveying the ground , Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill , which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power . This would light the stalls and warm them in winter , and would also run a circular saw , a chaff-cutter , a mangel -slicer , and an electric milking machine . The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before ( for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery ) , and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation . Within a few weeks Snowball 's plans for the windmill were fully worked out ."

Animal_Farm_697_28	literature	Nevertheless , as the summer wore on , various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt . There was need of paraffin oil , nails , string , dog biscuits , and iron for the horses ' shoes , none of which could be produced on the farm . Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures , besides various tools and , finally , the machinery for the windmill . How these were to be procured , no one was able to imagine . One Sunday morning , when the animals assembled to receive their orders , Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy . From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms : not , of course , for any commercial purpose , but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary . The needs of the windmill must override everything else , he said . He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year 's wheat crop , and later on , if more money were needed , it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs , for which there was always a market in Willingdon . The hens , said Napoleon , should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill . Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness . Never to have any dealings with human beings , never to engage in trade , never to make use of money - had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled ?

Animal_Farm_1459_4	literature	"But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream , the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water , and the three - day week , were no longer talked about . Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism . The truest happiness , he said , lay in working hard and living frugally . Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer - except , of course , for the pigs and the dogs . Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs . It was not that these creatures did not work , after their fashion . There was , as Squealer was never tired of explaining , endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm . Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand . For example , Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called "" files , "" "" reports , "" "" minutes , "" and "" memoranda . "" These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing , and as soon as they were so covered , they were burnt in the furnace .

Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion , when Jones 's expulsion was still recent , things had been better or worse than now . They could not remember . There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives : they had nothing to go upon except Squealer 's lists of figures , which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better . The animals found the problem insoluble ; in any case , they had little time for speculating on such things now . Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been , nor ever could be much better or much worse - hunger , hardship , and disappointment being , so he said , the unalterable law of life . And yet the animals never gave up hope . More , they never lost , even for an instant , their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm . They were still the only farm in the whole county - in all England ! - owned and operated by animals . Not one of them , not even the youngest , not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away , ever ceased to marvel at that .

Steven Farris, Apache's president and CEO said ""No one was injured, all personnel are safe, and the rupture and fire appear to be contained on the island...At this time, we cannot estimate when throughput will be resumed."" The facility was producing approximately 330 million cubic feet(MMcf) of natural gas and 8,000 barrels of crude oil per day, this has been reduced to 200 MMcf and 5,000 barrels per day.

The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.  Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

The eruption was visible from the Portland metropolitan area in the neighbouring state of Oregon, causing traffic slowdowns as commuters slowed to watch the spectacle.

The volcano has been building a new dome in its crater in recent months and causing tremors. It seems to have done enough damage to knock out at least two of the seismometers operated on its dome by the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network, although this could be the result of either damage to the seismometers themselves, or their telemetry equipment.

On Monday, the Romanian Prime Minister said that his country would not yield to terrorist demands, and it appears that this has caused the extension of the ultimatum by a day.

They come from a cache of papyri that were salvaged about a hundred years ago in the Greco-Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus.  The ink on many of these papyri had faded to the point that no text at all was visible to the naked eye, yet using state of the art techniques borrowed from satellite imaging, researchers were able to use infra-red light to see the faded ink.  There are thousands of manuscripts which are set to be read in this manner, and works of Sophocles, Euripides, and Hesiod which have been unavailable for well over a thousand years have already been recovered. The process by which these papyri are reconstructed is very time consuming — it will take a decade to finish the entire corpus. Among the documents set to be analysed include previously lost writings of Aeschylus, Ovid, and a series of Christian gospels.

N service currently stops one station short of Coney Island, at Gravesend-86th Street, and last reached Coney Island under regular service on November 4, 2001, though various General Orders caused by other closures have resulted in N trains running all the way.  The Sea Beach Line began in 1879 as the New York and Sea Beach Railway, a steam-powered railroad. It was bought by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company in 1897 and soon fitted with trolley wire, with connections to Manhattan via various elevated railways.  Reconstruction into a four-track depressed line was finished in 1915, and subway trains running to Midtown Manhattan started using the line. The Sea Beach Line was the fastest of the four lines connecting Coney Island to Manhattan, especially when the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line (last used in 1968) were in use, as there were no express stations between the split from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and Coney Island.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.  The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was set up ten years ago to investigate the effects of nutrition on cancer. Funded by the British Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, half a million people aged between 25 and 70 across Europe were studied from 1992 to 1998. The results are being published in the latest edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  After an average of five years, people who had eaten more than two portions of red and processed meats a day (160g) were 35% more likely to develop bowel cancer than those who only ate one portion a week.

r1153_2_7	TNE_train	Meth use now USA's top drug problem, survey finds  July 11, 2005}}&amp;nbs   Methamphetamine use is now the nation's most serious drug issue, according to a survey recently completed by the National Association of Counties (NaCO). The survey received responses from 500 county law enforcement agencies in 45 states. 58 percent of counties in the survey said that methamphetamine was their largest drug problem followed by cocaine (19%), marijuana (17%) and heroin (3%) as the most problematic drug for each county.  Methamphetamine is a growing problem, nearly double what it was three years ago in many regions. Over the last three years, 88 percent of counties have experienced an increase of meth-related crimes. Regions reporting the largest growth include the Upper Midwest, Southwest, and the Northwest - all reported a 93 percent increase in meth-related arrests. The Lower Midwest came in a close second with arrests increasing by 90 percent.  Meth labs use highly flammable and explosive materials to produce the drug. Due to this, meth labs have been known to explode in spectacularly devastating events. The waste produced in the process of making methamphetamine is disposed of using improper methods, leaving significant amounts of toxic waste in streams, groundwater, and septic systems.
